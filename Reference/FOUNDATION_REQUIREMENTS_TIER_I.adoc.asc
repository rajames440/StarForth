= StarForth Tier I: Foundation Requirements

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Requirements Specification
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

- ---

== Purpose

This document specifies EXACTLY what validation artifacts must exist for StarForth to claim Tier I (Foundation) compliance.

**For each requirement:**
1. **What it validates** — The specific concern
2. **How to prove it** — Evidence needed
3. **Artifacts required** — Documents, tests, reports
4. **Acceptance criteria** — What "done" means
5. **Status today** — What exists vs. what's missing

- ---

== Tier I: Foundation Requirements

=== Requirement T1-1: FORTH-79 Standard Compliance

**What it validates:** StarForth correctly implements every FORTH-79 core word.

**Standards reference:**
- - FORTH-79 official specification
- - ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 (Lifecycle) — Requirement traceability
- - ISO/IEC 25010 (Quality Model) — Functional correctness

**How to prove it:**
- - Every FORTH-79 core word is implemented
- - Every implementation matches the specification
- - Every word is tested

**Artifacts required:**

- - [ ] Every core word requirement traced to test
- - [ ] Every test traced to requirement
- - [ ] Every major function has documented purpose
- - [ ] RTM shows 100% coverage
- - [ ] No "orphan" tests (tests for nothing)
- - [ ] No "orphan" requirements (requirements with no test)

=== Requirement T1-3: Architecture and Design Documentation

**What it validates:** Design decisions are documented and justified.
