**Standards reference:**
- - MISRA C (pointer rules)
- - CERT C (memory safety)
- - ISO/IEC 5055

**How to prove it:**
- - Fixed memory arena eliminates malloc issues
- - Bounds checking prevents buffer overflows

**Artifacts required:**

[cols="2,3,1"]
|===
| Artifact | Description | Status

| `MEMORY_SAFETY_SPECIFICATION.adoc`
| Document safety model:
  - Fixed 5MB arena (no malloc)
  - Stack bounds (1024 cells)
  - Return stack bounds (1024 cells)
  - Dictionary size limits
  - Word definition size limits
  - Proof that no overflows possible
| ○ Needs creation

| Memory bounds test suite
| Tests for:
  - Maximum stack depth (1024)
  - Return stack depth (1024)
  - Dictionary overflow (attempt to add word larger than remaining space)
  - Address bounds (all addresses in arena)
  - Cell alignment (all cells 64-bit aligned)
| ○ Needs test cases

| Unsafe pointer analysis
| Identify all unsafe operations:
  - Explicit casts (type punning)
  - Pointer arithmetic
  - Dereferencing without bounds check
  - For each: Is it justified?
| ○ Needs analysis

| Fuzzing report
| Run fuzzer on word interpreter:
  - Generate random word sequences
  - Run for 1M+ iterations
  - No crashes or memory errors
  - Reports any issues found

| Compile with sanitizers enabled:
  - -fsanitize=address (buffer overflow)
  - -fsanitize=memory (uninitialized read)
  - Run full test suite
  - Zero errors reported
| ✓ Possible (needs automation)

|===

**Acceptance criteria:**
