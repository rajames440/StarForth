= StarForth Layer 3: Formal Assurance Framework (Stubs)

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Stub Framework (To Be Completed in Phase 3)
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

---

== Executive Summary

This document defines the **structure and placeholder content** for Layer 3 formal verification. These are **NOT yet written**, but the framework is designed so work can begin immediately when needed.

Layer 3 validation will use **Isabelle/HOL theorem proving** to mathematically prove that StarForth kernel is correct.

---

== Vision: Formally-Verified Microkernel

When StarForth becomes the kernel (Phase 3):

[source,text]
----
Current (Phase 1-2):          Phase 3 (Goal):
┌──────────────┐              ┌──────────────┐
│ StarForth VM │ verified      │ StarForth    │ formally
│ (component)  │ by testing    │ Microkernel  │ proven
└──────────────┘              └──────────────┘
     ↓                             ↓
┌──────────────┐              ┌──────────────┐
│ L4Re/seL4    │ (external)    │ Isabelle/HOL │ proofs
│ Hypervisor   │              │ Verified     │
└──────────────┘              └──────────────┘

We are NOT trying to re-prove seL4.
We ARE proving StarForth's kernel-level properties:
- Word ACL enforcement
- Dictionary isolation
- Scheduler soundness
- Message broker reliability
- Capability immutability

== Layer 3 Validation Questions

=== Question L3-1: ACL Enforcement Correctness

**Question:** Can we PROVE that no word can violate ACLs?

**What we must prove:**
[source,text]
----
Theorem ACL_ENFORCEMENT_CORRECTNESS:
  ∀ VM, ∀ WORD, ∀ STATE:
    Execute(VM, WORD, STATE)
    ⇒ (VM ∈ ACL(WORD)) ∨ Exception

Theorem ACL_IMMUTABILITY:
  ∀ WORD, ∀ VM, ∀ CODE:
    WORD(CODE) cannot modify ACL(WORD)

Theorem NO_ACL_BYPASS:
  ∀ VM:
    VM cannot find or execute word(s)
    outside its ACL
----

**Scope:** TBD (will define in Phase 3)

---

=== Question L3-2: Word Composition Safety

**Question:** Can we PROVE that arbitrary word sequences are safe?

**What we must prove:**
[source,text]
----
Theorem WORD_COMPOSITION_SAFETY:
  ∀ WORDS: sequence of valid words
  ∀ INITIAL_STATE:
    Execute(WORDS, INITIAL_STATE)
    ⇒ FINAL_STATE is safe
    (where "safe" = stacks within bounds, memory valid, no undefined behavior)

Theorem STACK_SAFETY:
  ∀ WORD, ∀ STATE:
    Execute(WORD, STATE)
    ⇒ |DATA_STACK| ≤ 1024 ∧ |RETURN_STACK| ≤ 1024

Theorem DICTIONARY_CLOSURE:
  All words reachable from root word
  All words are valid (no corrupted code)
----

**Scope:** TBD (will define in Phase 3)

---

=== Question L3-3: Scheduler Correctness

**Question:** Can we PROVE the physics-informed scheduler is correct?

**What we must prove:**
[source,text]
----
Theorem SCHEDULER_FAIRNESS:
  Every VM eventually gets CPU time
  No VM can starve others

Theorem SCHEDULER_DETERMINISM:
  Same initial state + same events
  ⇒ Same scheduling sequence

Theorem ENTROPY_DISTRIBUTION:
  Physics algorithm distributes entropy
  within <5% variance
  (depends on algorithm specification)

Theorem NO_PRIORITY_INVERSION:
  Lower priority task cannot block
  higher priority task indefinitely
----

**Scope:** TBD (algorithm must be finalized first)

---

=== Question L3-4: Isolation Guarantees

**Question:** Can we PROVE that VMs cannot interfere with each other?

**What we must prove:**
[source,text]
----
Theorem MEMORY_ISOLATION:
  ∀ VM-A, ∀ VM-B (A ≠ B):
    VM-A cannot read/write VM-B memory

Theorem DICTIONARY_ISOLATION:
  ∀ VM-A, ∀ VM-B (A ≠ B):
    VM-A dictionary ∩ VM-B dictionary = ∅
    (dictionaries are disjoint)

Theorem CAPABILITY_NON_FORGERY:
  VM cannot create capability for
  which it was not granted

Theorem CAPABILITY_NON_REVOCATION:
  Revoked capability cannot be reused
  (need: revocation mechanism design)
----

**Scope:** TBD (will define in Phase 3)

---

=== Question L3-5: Message Broker Reliability

**Question:** Can we PROVE the pub/sub broker is reliable?

**What we must prove:**
[source,text]
----
Theorem MESSAGE_DELIVERY:
  ∀ sender, ∀ message, ∀ topic:
    Publish(sender, message, topic)
    ⇒ All subscribers receive message

Theorem MESSAGE_ORDERING:
  ∀ topic:
    Messages published in order
    are delivered in order
    (per subscriber)

Theorem MESSAGE_INTEGRITY:
  Message cannot be corrupted
  in transit

Theorem NO_MESSAGE_LOSS:
  No message lost unless
  subscriber offline
  (need: offline queueing design)
----

**Scope:** TBD (will define in Phase 3)

== Timeline and Effort

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===

| Formalization
| 4-8 weeks
| Phase 3, Year 1

| Proof development
| 8-16 weeks
| Phase 3, Year 1-2

| Proof review & publication
| 2-4 weeks
| Phase 3, Year 2

| **Total**
| **14-28 weeks**
| **Phase 3 (2026+)**

|===

**Note:** Effort estimates are highly variable depending on:
- Complexity of scheduler algorithm
- Availability of seL4 theorems library
- Team expertise with Isabelle/HOL
- Scope of proofs (full kernel vs. critical components)

---

== Dependencies and Prerequisites

### For Layer 3 to start, we need:

1. **Phase 3 timeline confirmed**
   - When will StarForth become a kernel?
   - What's the hard deadline?

2. **Scheduler algorithm finalized**
   - Physics-informed scheduling must be specified
   - Fairness and determinism properties must be clear
   - Entropy distribution model must be documented

3. **Capability model finalized**
   - ACL structure must be designed
   - Revocation mechanism must be designed
   - Capability creation/destruction must be specified

4. **Message broker specification completed**
   - Ordering guarantees must be defined
   - Queue behavior must be specified
   - Offline queueing (if any) must be designed

5. **Formal verification expertise**
   - Team or consultant with Isabelle/HOL experience
   - seL4 verification methodology knowledge
   - Theorem proving best practices

---

== Assumptions and Limitations

### What Layer 3 PROVES:

- ✓ Kernel software logic is correct
- ✓ Word semantics match specification
- ✓ ACLs prevent unauthorized access
- ✓ Memory isolation is enforced
- ✓ Scheduler is fair and deterministic

### What Layer 3 CANNOT PROVE:

- ✗ Hardware is correct (CPU, MMU, interrupt controller)
- ✗ Compiler is correct (but CompCert can help)
- ✗ Assumptions are perfect (but assumptions are explicit)
- ✗ External threats (side-channel attacks need separate analysis)
- ✗ Power-off safety (need separate power-loss recovery spec)

### Explicit Assumptions (to be documented):

- [ ] Compiler produces correct machine code (or use CompCert)
- [ ] Hardware interrupts are delivered reliably
- [ ] Memory model matches Isabelle assumptions
- [ ] Clock has minimum granularity (for scheduler)
- [ ] No cosmic rays/radiation (or fault tolerance needed)
