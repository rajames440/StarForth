section \<open>Algebra --- Classical Algebra, using Explicit Structures and Locales\<close>

text \<open>
  This directory contains proofs in classical algebra. It is intended as a
  base for any algebraic development in Isabelle. Emphasis is on reusability.
  This is achieved by modelling algebraic structures as first-class citizens
  of the logic (not axiomatic type classes, say). The library is expected to
  grow in future releases of Isabelle. Contributions are welcome.

subsection \<open>GroupTheory, including Sylow's Theorem\<close>

text \<open>
  These proofs are mainly by Florian Kamm√ºller. (Later, Larry Paulson
  simplified some of the proofs.) These theories were indeed the original
  motivation for locales.

  Here is an outline of the directory's contents:

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>Group.thy\<close> defines semigroups, monoids, groups, commutative
    monoids, commutative groups, homomorphisms and the subgroup relation. It
    also defines the product of two groups (This theory was reimplemented by
    Clemens Ballarin).

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>FiniteProduct.thy\<close> extends commutative groups by a product
    operator for finite sets (provided by Clemens Ballarin).

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>Coset.thy\<close> defines the factorization of a group and shows that
    the factorization a normal subgroup is a group.

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>Bij.thy\<close> defines bijections over sets and operations on them and
    shows that they are a group. It shows that automorphisms form a group.

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>Exponent.thy\<close> the combinatorial argument underlying Sylow's
    first theorem.

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>Sylow.thy\<close> contains a proof of the first Sylow theorem.

subsection \<open>Rings and Polynomials\<close>

text \<open>
  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>Ring.thy\<close> defines Abelian monoids and groups. The difference to
    commutative structures is merely notational: the binary operation is
    addition rather than multiplication. Commutative rings are obtained by
    inheriting properties from Abelian groups and commutative monoids. Further
    structures in the algebraic hierarchy of rings: integral domain.

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>Module.thy\<close> introduces the notion of a R-left-module over an
    Abelian group, where R is a ring.

  \<^item> Theory \<^file>\<open>UnivPoly.thy\<close> constructs univariate polynomials over rings and
    integral domains. Degree function. Universal Property.

subsection \<open>Development of Polynomials using Type Classes\<close>

text \<open>
  A development of univariate polynomials for HOL's ring classes is available
  at \<^file>\<open>~~/src/HOL/Computational_Algebra/Polynomial.thy\<close>.
