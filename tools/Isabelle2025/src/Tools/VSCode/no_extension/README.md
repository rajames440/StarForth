# Isabelle/VSCode Prover IDE (PIDE)

This extension is obsolete!

Isabelle2021-1 (December 2021) is the last Isabelle release with a separate
VSCode extension on the public marketplace (see "makarius.Isabelle2021-1").

Starting with Isabelle2022, a fully integrated Isabelle/VSCode with
corresponding extension is incorporated into the Isabelle distribution.
