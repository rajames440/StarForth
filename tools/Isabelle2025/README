The Isabelle System Distribution
================================

See the NEWS file in the distribution for details on user-relevant
changes.  The ANNOUNCE file recounts notable changes for the latest
official release.

The core of Isabelle is subject to a 3-clause BSD license, but add-on
components have their own license schemes (similar to a Linux
distribution).


Installation
------------

Isabelle works on the three main platform families: Linux, Windows,
and macOS.  The application bundles from the Isabelle web page
include sources, documentation, and add-on tools for all supported
platforms.

Some technical background information may be found in the Isabelle
System Manual (directory doc).


User interface
--------------

Isabelle/jEdit is an advanced Prover IDE based on jEdit and
Isabelle/Scala.  It is the main example application of the
Isabelle/PIDE framework, and the default user interface of
Isabelle.  It provides a metaphor of continuous proof checking of a
versioned collection of theory sources, with instantaneous feedback
in real-time and rich semantic markup associated with the formal
text.
