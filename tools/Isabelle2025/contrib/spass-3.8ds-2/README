This distribution of SPASS 3.8ds, described in Blanchette, Popescu, Wand, and
Weidenbach's ITP 2012 paper "More SPASS with Isabelle", has been compiled from
sources available at https://www.cs.vu.nl/~jbe248/spass-3.8ds-src.tar.gz
via "make".

The Windows/Cygwin compilation required commenting out the line

    #include "execinfo.h"

in "misc.c" as well as most of the body of the "misc_DumpCore" function.

The latest official SPASS sources can be downloaded from
http://www.spass-prover.org/. Be aware, however, that the official SPASS
releases are not compatible with Isabelle.


Viel SPASS!
