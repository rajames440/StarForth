This is OPAM 2.0.7 -- the OCaml Package Manager.

The executables for linux and darwin are from
https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/2.0.7

In order to work properly, the underlying OS platform needs to provide
standard build tools for C/OCaml development. Windows/Cygwin requires
a separate package "opam" version 2.0.x.
