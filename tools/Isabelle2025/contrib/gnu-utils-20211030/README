These are some GNU utilities for macOS, which are provided by default
on Linux and Windows/Cygwin.  The executables have been built using
standard "./configure && make" on the original sources:

  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.32.tar.xz
  https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tar/tar-1.32.tar.gz

For x86_64-darwin the reference platform is macOS 10.13 High Sierra,
for arm64-darwin it is macOS 11.x Big Sur.
