This is E prover 3.1 from
https://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/WORK/E_DOWNLOAD/V_3.1/E.tgz

* On Windows/Cygwin, the sources have been patched to remove setpgid in
  PROVER/eprover.c

* The distribution has been built like this:

    cd src && ./configure --enable-ho && make

* Some executables from PROVERS/ have been moved to the platform-specific
Isabelle component directory: x86_64-linux etc.
