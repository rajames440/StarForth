This distribution of Z3 4.4.0 unstable (pre-release, revision 0482e7fe727c) was
assembled from

    https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
    http://z3.codeplex.com/releases

The Windows version was copied from the "bin" directory of the
"Windows x86 unstable" archive "z3-4.4.0.0482e7fe727c-x86-win.zip",
obtained from

    http://z3.codeplex.com/releases/view/101914

The EXE and DLL files were set to be executable using "chmod +x".

For Linux and macOS, custom binaries were built from the source code,
obtained from

    https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

The Linux executables were built on a 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
installation running on VirtualBox VM. The Mac executables were built
on a 64-bit macOS X 10.7 (Lion) server called "macbroy6". FPA support
had to be disabled on macOS to work around "duplicate symbol" linker
errors.  The executables were "strip"ped.

Enjoy!
