XZ for Java release notes
=========================

1.10 (2024-07-29)
-----------------

* Licensing change: From version 1.10 onwards, XZ for Java is under
  the BSD Zero Clause License (0BSD). 1.9 and older are in the
  public domain and obviously remain so; the change only affects
  the new releases.

  0BSD is an extremely permissive license which doesn't require
  retaining or reproducing copyright or license notices when
  distributing the code, thus in practice there is extremely
  little difference to public domain.

* Mark copyright and license information in the source package so
  that it is compliant to the [REUSE Specification version 3.2](
  <https://reuse.software/spec-3.2/>).

* Improve LZMAInputStream.enableRelaxedEndCondition():

    - Error detection is slightly better.

    - The input position will always be at the end of the stream
      after successful decompression.

* Support .lzma files that have both a known uncompressed size and
  the end marker. Such files are uncommon but valid. The same issue
  was fixed in XZ Utils 5.2.6 in 2022.

* Add ARM64 and RISC-V BCJ filters.

* Speed optimizations:
    - Delta filter
    - LZMA/LZMA2 decoder
    - LZMA/LZMA2 encoder (partially Java >= 9 only)
    - CRC64 (Java >= 9 only)

* Changes that affect API/ABI compatibility:

    - Change XZOutputStream constructors to not call the method
      `public void updateFilters(FilterOptions[] filterOptions)`.

    - In SeekableXZInputStream, change the method
      `public void seekToBlock(int blockNumber)` to not call
      the method `public long getBlockPos(int blockNumber)`.

    - Make the filter options classes `final`:
        * ARM64Options
        * ARMOptions
        * ARMThumbOptions
        * DeltaOptions
        * IA64Options
        * LZMA2Options
        * PowerPCOptions
        * RISCVOptions
        * SPARCOptions
        * X86Options

* Add new system properties:

    - `org.tukaani.xz.ArrayCache` sets the default ArrayCache:
      `Dummy` (default) or `Basic`. See the documentation of
      ArrayCache and BasicArrayCache.

    - `org.tukaani.xz.MatchLengthFinder` (Java >= 9 only) sets the
      byte array comparison method used for finding match lengths in
      LZMA/LZMA2 encoder: `UnalignedLongLE` (default on x86-64 and
      ARM64) or `Basic` (default on other systems). The former could
      be worth testing on other 64-bit little endian systems that
      support fast unaligned memory access.

* Build system (Apache Ant):

    - Building the documentation no longer downloads `element-list`
      or `package-list` file; the build is now fully offline. Such
      files aren't needed with OpenJDK >= 16 whose `javadoc` can
      auto-link to platform documentation on docs.oracle.com. With
      older OpenJDK versions, links to platform documentation aren't
      generated anymore.

    - Don't require editing of build.properties to build with
      OpenJDK 8. Now it's enough to use `ant -Djava8only=true`.
      Older OpenJDK versions are no longer supported because
      the main source tree uses Java 8 features.

    - Support reproducible builds. See the notes in README.md.

    - Add a new Ant target `pom` that only creates xz.pom.

    - Change `ant dist` to use `git archive` to create a .zip file.

* Convert the plain text documentation in the source tree to
  Markdown (CommonMark).

* The binaries of 1.10 in the Maven Central require Java 8 and
  contain optimized classes for Java >= 9 as multi-release JAR.
  They were built with OpenJDK 21.0.4 on GNU/Linux using the
  following command:

      SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1722262226 TZ=UTC0 ant maven

1.9 (2021-03-12)
----------------

* Add LZMAInputStream.enableRelaxedEndCondition(). It allows
  decompression of LZMA streams whose uncompressed size is known
  but it is unknown if the end of stream marker is present. This
  method is meant to be useful in Apache Commons Compress to
  support .7z files created by certain very old 7-Zip versions.
  Such files have the end of stream marker in the LZMA data even
  though the uncompressed size is known. 7-Zip supports such files
  and thus other implementations of the .7z format should support
  them too.

* Make LZMA/LZMA2 decompression faster. With files that compress
  extremely well the performance can be a lot better but with
  more typical files the improvement is minor.

* Make the CRC64 code faster.

* Add module-info.java as multi-release JAR. The attribute
  `Automatic-Module-Name` was removed.

* The binaries for XZ for Java 1.9 in the Maven Central now
  require Java 7. Building the package requires at least Java 9
  for module-info support but otherwise the code should still be
  Java 5 compatible (see README and comments in build.properties).

1.8 (2018-01-04)
----------------

* Fix a binary compatibility regression: XZ for Java 1.7 binaries
  in the Maven Central require Java 9 which is too new. XZ for
  Java 1.8 binaries require Java 5. (XZ for Java 1.6 and older
  binaries require Java 1.4.)

  If you are using OpenJDK 9 or later, you will need to edit the
  `sourcever = 1.5` line in the file build.properties before
  running `ant`. Set it to `1.6` or higher. The default value `1.5`
  isn't supported by OpenJDK 9 or later.

* Add `Automatic-Module-Name` = `org.tukaani.xz`.

1.7 (2017-12-29)
----------------

* Fix LZMA2InputStream.available() which could return a too high
  value in case of uncompressed LZMA2 chunks. This incorrect
  value was visible via other available() methods too, for example,
  XZInputStream.available().

* Add the ArrayCache API. It's a pool-like API to reuse large byte
  and int arrays between compressor and decompressor instances.
  If you are (de)compressing many tiny files in a row, taking
  advantage of this API can improve performance significantly.

1.6 (2016-11-27)
----------------

* Fix LZMA2Options.getInputStream to work with a preset dictionary.

* Make it possible to disable verification of integrity checks in
  XZ decompression. It should almost never be used but may be useful
  in some rare situations. This feature is available via new
  constructors in XZInputStream, SingleXZInputStream, and
  SeekableXZInputStream.

* Add LZMAOutputStream for encoding to raw LZMA (i.e. LZMA1) streams
  and to the legacy .lzma format.

1.5 (2014-03-08)
----------------

* Fix a wrong assertion in BCJ decoders.

* Use a field instead of reallocating a temporary one-byte buffer
  in read() and write() implementations in several classes.

1.4 (2013-09-22)
----------------

* Add LZMAInputStream for decoding .lzma files and raw LZMA streams.

1.3 (2013-05-12)
----------------

* Fix a data corruption bug when flushing the LZMA2 encoder or
  when using a preset dictionary.

* Make information about the XZ Block positions and sizes available
  in SeekableXZInputStream by adding the following public functions:
    - int getStreamCount()
    - int getBlockCount()
    - long getBlockPos(int blockNumber)
    - long getBlockSize(int blockNumber)
    - long getBlockCompPos(int blockNumber)
    - long getBlockCompSize(int blockNumber)
    - int getBlockCheckType(int blockNumber)
    - int getBlockNumber(long pos)
    - void seekToBlock(int blockNumber)

* Minor improvements to javadoc comments were made.

1.2 (2013-01-29)
----------------

* Use fields instead of reallocating frequently-needed temporary
  objects in the LZMA encoder.

* Fix the contents of xz-${version}-sources.jar.

* Add OSGi attributes to xz.jar.

1.1 (2012-07-05)
----------------

* The depthLimit argument in the LZMA2Options constructor is
  no longer ignored.

* LZMA2Options() can no longer throw UnsupportedOptionsException.

* Fix bugs in the preset dictionary support in the LZMA2 encoder.

1.0 (2011-10-22)
----------------

* The first stable release
