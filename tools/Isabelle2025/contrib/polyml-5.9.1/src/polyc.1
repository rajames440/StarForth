.TH POLY 1 "Poly/ML Version 5.9.1 2023"
.SH NAME
polyc \- Compile and link a Standard ML program using Poly/ML
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B polyc
.I sourcefile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I polyc 
is a script that compiles a Standard ML program using the Poly/ML compiler and creates an
executable program from it.  It can also be used to link object files created using the
PolyML.export function with the Poly/ML libraries or to produce an object file.  When
used to compile a Standard ML program it expects the main function to be called "main"
e.g.
fun main() = print "Hello World\\n";

If the source file is a text file it is assumed to be ML source.  If it is a binary file
it is assumed to be an object file and will be linked with the Poly/ML library.
