<h5 align="center">David C.J. Matthews 2001. Updated 2009.</h5>

<p>This is a brief introduction to programming with the Windows&#153; interface in
Poly/ML.&nbsp; It is arranged as a tutorial around the <a href="mlEdit.html">mlEdit</a>
example, a small example text editor.&nbsp; It is not intended as a full description of
writing programs for Windows and is no substitute for a more general guide.&nbsp; If you
are planning to develop an application using this interface it is probably worth
purchasing a book or CD_ROM reference for Windows such as the Microsoft Developer Network
library.</p>

<p>This introduction assumes some familiarity with programming in ML and perhaps some
experience of other windowing systems, such as X-Windows.&nbsp; It does not assume any
experience of programming with Windows and, for experienced Windows programmers, it will
cover familiar ground.&nbsp; It does, though, point out some of the differences between
the ML interface and that of other languages.&nbsp; The interface functions in ML are very
similar to the underlying C functions.&nbsp; The main differences are in the types of the
arguments and a few other changes necessary for ML.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information see
the <a href="../Winref/Reference.html">Windows Interface Reference.</a></p>

<p>The original version of the Windows interface was written at AHL by Panos Aguieris.&nbsp; 
  It uses the Poly/ML <a href="../Reference/Foreign.html">Foreign structure</a> 
  to provide nearly all the interface.&nbsp; It was extensively modified and expanded 
  by David Matthews.</p>

<h3><a name="Windows">1. Windows, Messages and Window Procedures</a></h3>

<p>When thinking about a window we tend to think of a top-level application or a document
window.&nbsp; From the point of view of programming, though, this is just one variety.
&nbsp; In fact each label, menu and text box is a window but because they form part of a
bigger application they tend to be overlooked.&nbsp; These are <em>child windows</em>.
&nbsp; Nearly every window has to deal with two main areas of concern.&nbsp; There has to
be a way of displaying the contents of the window and there has to be a way of handling
user input, whether by the mouse or from the keyboard.</p>

<p>Most communication with windows is by sending <em>messages</em>.&nbsp; A message may be
sent as a result of user input, such as moving the mouse or typing a character at the
keyboard.&nbsp; It may also be sent by the application to change the appearance of the
window or to get information from it.&nbsp; There are over two hundred different message
types defined by Windows and it is possible to define your own for use within an
application.&nbsp; Many of these are only relevant in special circumstances and only a few
are used regularly.&nbsp; It's worth noting in passing that messages can be sent from one
process to a window in another process and that <em>hidden windows</em>, windows which
don't appear on the screen but are only ever used to receive messages, are one of the
standard ways of communicating between processes in Windows.</p>

<p>The appearance of a window is largely governed by how it responds to different kinds of
messages.&nbsp; Every window has a <em>window procedure</em> which processes messages sent
to the window.&nbsp; When you create a window you give the <em>class</em> of the window
you want to create and the new window uses the window procedure for that class.&nbsp; You
can either use a standard class, such as <a href="../Winref/Class.html#Edit">Edit</a>, or you
can create your own class using your own window procedure using <a href="../Winref/Class.html#RegisterClassEx">RegisterClassEx</a>.&nbsp; You will nearly always
need to create at least one class for your top-level window.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To see how this works in practice let's look at an extract from the mlEdit example.
&nbsp; </p>

<pre>fun wndProc(hw: HWND, msg: Message, state as SOME{edit, fileName, ...}) =
    case msg of
    |   WM_CLOSE =&gt;
        (if checkForSave(hw, edit, fileName) then DefWindowProc(hw, msg) else LRESINT 0, state)
    .....
    |   _ =&gt; (DefWindowProc(hw, msg), state)
    .....
and fun checkForSave ....</pre>
<p>This extract from the window procedure, wndProc, processes the <a href="../Winref/Message.html#WM_CLOSE">WM_CLOSE</a> 
  message. &nbsp; This message has no parameters and is generated by the system 
  when the user clicks in the close box of the window (the box at the top left 
  of the window with a cross in it). &nbsp; Every message is sent to the window 
  procedure.&nbsp; When writing a window procedure we are often only interested 
  in handling a few of the possibilities so Windows performs a default action 
  if we don't want to handle the message.&nbsp; Even if we do handle it we can 
  pass it on for default processing when we have dealt with it.&nbsp; The default 
  action for WM_CLOSE is to destroy the window by a call to <a href="../Winref/Window.html#DestroyWindow">DestroyWindow</a>.&nbsp; 
  In our application we want to ask the user whether to save the window if the 
  text being edited has been modified.&nbsp; This process also gives the user 
  the opportunity for second thoughts and they may cancel the closure.&nbsp; This 
  is handled by our function checkForSave which returns true if it is safe to 
  close the window. &nbsp; Window procedures in ML return a pair as their result.&nbsp; 
  The first field of the pair is the Windows result value.&nbsp; For many messages 
  a result of LRESINT 0 is suitable.&nbsp; In this example we return SOME(LRESINT 
  0) if we don't want the window to be destroyed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The full type of a window procedure in ML is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>HWND * Message * 'a -&gt; LRESULT * 'a</tt><br>
The third argument is the <em>state</em> of the window and an updated version of the state
is returned as part of the result.&nbsp; This allows the window procedure to process a
message and update the state as part of the process.&nbsp; It is an ML extension which is
not part of the underlying message system.&nbsp; In our extract we return the previous
state unchanged.</p>

<p>The mlEdit example works by constructing a parent window using a custom class and our
own window procedure and then making a child window within it using the system Edit class.
&nbsp; The Edit window deals with all the keyboard input so saving us the need to write
this ourselves.&nbsp; Our window procedure has to process messages to do with menu
selection and other messages sent to top-level windows.&nbsp; </p>

<pre>    WM_SETFOCUS _ =&gt;
        (
         SetFocus(SOME edit);
         (DefWindowProc(hw, msg), state)
        )
    
|    WM_SIZE{height, width, ...} =&gt;
        (
         MoveWindow{hWnd=edit, x=0, y=0, height=height, width=width, repaint=true};
         (DefWindowProc(hw, msg), state)
        )
</pre>
<p>The <a href="../Winref/Message.html#WM_SETFOCUS">WM_SETFOCUS</a> message is sent when the
user clicks on a window and is intended to set the keyboard focus to that window (i.e.
selects the window to receive keyboard input).&nbsp; The edit child window occupies the
centre of our window so the WM_FOCUS message will be sent directly to it if the user
clicks within that area.&nbsp; Since we are not interested in receiving characters in our
top-level window we set the focus to the edit window if the user clicks on the border.
&nbsp; While it isn't essential to process this message at all for the mlEdit application
to work correctly, by doing so we improve its usability.</p>

<p>The <a href="../Winref/Message.html#WM_SIZE">WM_SIZE</a> message is sent if the window is
resized.&nbsp; Among the parameters to the window are the height and width of the <em>client
area</em>, the area excluding the border and the menu bar.&nbsp; This is the area we want
to use for our edit window so we use <a href="../Winref/Window.html#MoveWindow">MoveWindow</a>
to set its size.&nbsp; Calling MoveWindow causes the edit window to receive a WM_SIZE
message.&nbsp; The window procedure for the edit window uses this to adjust the format of
the text within the window to suit the new size.&nbsp; We do not need to be concerned
about how this happens in our application.&nbsp; WM_SIZE is also sent when a window is
created.&nbsp; This is convenient and means we do not need to set the size of the edit
window when we create it.</p>

<h3><a name="Child">2. Creating the child window</a></h3>

<p>So far we have not described how the edit window is created.&nbsp; We need it to be a
child window of the top-level window and the easiest way to do that is to create it when
the <a href="../Winref/Message.html#WM_CREATE">WM_CREATE</a> message is received.&nbsp; This
message is sent as part of the process of creation of the top-level window.</p>

<pre>fun wndProc(hw: HWND, msg: Message, NONE) =
    (
    case msg of
        WM_CREATE _ =&gt; (* Create an edit window and return it as the state. *)
        let
            val edit =
             CreateWindow{class = Class.Edit, name = &quot;&quot;,
                style = Edit.Style.flags[Edit.Style.WS_CHILD, Edit.Style.WS_VISIBLE, Edit.Style.WS_VSCROLL,
                            Edit.Style.ES_LEFT, Edit.Style.ES_MULTILINE, Edit.Style.ES_AUTOVSCROLL],
                            x  = 0, y = 0, height = 0, width = 0, relation = ChildWindow{parent=hw, id=99},
                            instance = Globals.ApplicationInstance(), init = ()}</pre>
<pre>            (* We also set the font for the edit window here.  This has been omitted. *)
         in
            (LRESINT 0, SOME{edit=edit, devMode=NONE, devNames = NONE, fileName=&quot;&quot;})
        end

    | _ =&gt; (DefWindowProc(hw, msg), NONE)
    )</pre>

<p>This extract of the window procedure shows the creation of the edit window as part of
processing WM_CREATE.&nbsp; We use <a href="../Winref/Window.html#CreateWindow">CreateWindow</a>
which makes a window of a specified class and returns a handle to it.&nbsp; Once we have
processed the message we set the state to SOME of a record containing a handle to the edit
window.&nbsp; (Instead of doing this we could use <a href="../WinRef/Dialog.html#GetDlgItem">GetDlgItem</a>
to find it each time we needed it, but this is easier).&nbsp; At this stage we just pass
zeros for the size of the window since we will use the WM_SIZE message to set its size.
&nbsp; The id value for the child window (we use 99) is irrelevant in this example since
we never use it.&nbsp; The style does not include horizontal scrolling so the edit window
uses word-wrapping. </p>

<h3><a name="Parent">3. Creating the parent window</a></h3>

<p>It's now time to see how we create the main window itself.&nbsp; Since we want to use
our own window procedure we need to register a class even though we will only create a
single window of this class.</p>

<pre>val polyIcon = ...
val menu = ...
val className = &quot;mlEditWindowClass&quot;
val app = Globals.ApplicationInstance()
(* Register a class for the top-level window.  Use the Poly icon from the application. *)
val myWindowClass = RegisterClassEx{style = Class.Style.flags[], wndProc = wndProc, hInstance = app,
    hIcon = SOME polyIcon, hCursor = NONE, hbrBackGround = NONE, menuName = NONE,
    className = className, hIconSm = NONE};


val w = CreateWindow{class = myWindowClass, name = &quot;mlEdit&quot;, style = Window.Style.WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
    x  = CW_USEDEFAULT, y = CW_USEDEFAULT, height = CW_USEDEFAULT, width = CW_USEDEFAULT,
    relation = PopupWindow menu, instance = app, init = NONE};
in
ShowWindow(w, SW_SHOW);
SetForegroundWindow w;

RunApplication();
UnregisterClass(className, app)
end;</pre>

<p>In the mlEdit example we use the icon from the Poly/ML application.&nbsp; It isn't
necessary to provide an icon: Windows will provide a default one if NONE is given for
hIcon.&nbsp; We use the WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW style for the window which is the standard for
a top-level window and gives a standard border with a system menu and minimise, maximise
and close boxes.&nbsp; CW_USEDEFAULT is used for the size and position of the window.
&nbsp; The user can always move or resize it once it has been created.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
create the window with the PopupWindow value and pass the menu to be used.&nbsp; Once the
window has been created we call ShowWindow to make it visible and SetForegroundWindow to
make it appear above other windows.</p>

<p>Some messages are sent to the window procedure as a result of calling the functions
such as CreateWindow.&nbsp; Generally, though, messages are queued and have to be
explicitly dequeued and passed to the window procedure.&nbsp; In C this is done by a
message loop with GetMessage and DispatchMessage.&nbsp; In ML we use the <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#RunApplication">RunApplication</a> function which deals with all
this.&nbsp; RunApplication returns when a <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#WM_QUIT">WM_QUIT</a>
message is received.&nbsp; To ensure that this happens we have to put this message into
the queue.&nbsp; The easiest way to do this is to call PostQuitMessage when the window is
about to go away.&nbsp; We have already seen how DestroyWindow is called as a result of
processing the WM_CLOSE message.&nbsp; DestroyWindow sends <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#WM_DESTROY">WM_DESTROY</a> and <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#WM_NCDESTROY">WM_NCDESTROY</a> messages to the window procedure
to allow it to clean up properly.&nbsp; WM_NCDESTROY will be the last message to be sent
to this window procedure so we call PostQuitMessage while handling it.</p>

<pre>|    WM_NCDESTROY =&gt;
        (
         PostQuitMessage 0;
         (DefWindowProc(hw, msg), state)
        )</pre>
<p>We need to call <a href="../WinRef/Class.html#UnregisterClass">UnregisterClass</a> when
RunApplication returns.&nbsp; Classes are automatically unregistered when the application
terminates but in this context the application is the whole Poly/ML session so if we want
to run mlEdit again within the same session we need to unregister the class. &nbsp;
Otherwise the next time we call RegisterClassEx with the same name it will fail because
the class is already registered.</p>

<h3><a name="Menus">4. Menus</a></h3>

<p>We have already seen that a menu can be set up by passing its handle as part of the
PopupWindow value to CreateWindow.&nbsp; Let's see how the menu itself is created and how
it is processed.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways a menu can be created but perhaps the simplest is to build
it up using calls to <a href="../WinRef/Menu.html#CreateMenu">CreateMenu</a> and <a href="../WinRef/Menu.html#AppendMenu">AppendMenu</a>.&nbsp; The structure we want for our
menu is a bar containing File, Edit and Help menus each with several menu items.&nbsp; In
general a menu consists of multiple items, each of which may either be a command item or
may pull up a sub-menu.</p>

<pre>val menuOpen = 1
and menuQuit = 2
and menuSave = 3
...</pre>

<pre>val fileMenu =
    let
        val fileMenu = CreateMenu();
    in
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId menuOpen, MFT_STRING &quot;&amp;Open&quot;);
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId menuSave, MFT_STRING &quot;&amp;Save&quot;);
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId menuSaveAs, MFT_STRING &quot;Save &amp;As...&quot;);
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId 0, MFT_SEPARATOR);
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId menuPageSetup, MFT_STRING &quot;Page Set&amp;up...&quot;);
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId menuPrint, MFT_STRING &quot;P&amp;rint...&quot;);
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId 0, MFT_SEPARATOR);
        AppendMenu(fileMenu, [], MenuId menuQuit, MFT_STRING &quot;&amp;Quit&quot;);
        fileMenu
    end;</pre>

<p>We create the file menu by calling CreateMenu and then AppendMenu for each item. &nbsp;
Every item, apart from separators, has a different item ID.&nbsp; The values are arbitrary
but we need to use different values for each because these are the values which will be
passed to our window procedure when a particular menu item is selected. &nbsp; Separators,
which appear as horizontal lines when the menu is pulled down, are used to improve the
layout.&nbsp; The ampersands (&amp;s) precede the character which will be underlined in
the menu.&nbsp; These provide keyboard shortcuts for menu items.&nbsp; Typically the first
character is used but sometimes we have to use another character in order to give all the
items in a menu different characters.</p>

<pre>val menu = CreateMenu();
val _ = AppendMenu(menu, [], MenuHandle fileMenu, MFT_STRING &quot;&amp;File&quot;);
val _ = AppendMenu(menu, [], MenuHandle editMenu, MFT_STRING &quot;&amp;Edit&quot;)
val _ = AppendMenu(menu, [], MenuHandle helpMenu, MFT_STRING &quot;&amp;Help&quot;)</pre>

<p>We can create the edit and help menus in exactly the same way.&nbsp; When they have
been created we can build the full menu.&nbsp; The argument to AppendMenu is MenuHandle
rather than MenuId since these are sub-menus.</p>

<p>As with all other input selecting a menu item causes the system to send a message to
the window.&nbsp; It sends a <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#WM_COMMAND">WM_COMMAND</a>
message with information about the particular menu item.&nbsp; The wId value in the
messagecontains the identifier which was used when the menu was created.&nbsp; </p>

<pre>|    WM_COMMAND{notifyCode = 0, wId, control} =&gt;

        if wId = menuQuit
        then
        (
        if checkForSave(hw, edit, fileName) then DestroyWindow hw else();
        (LRESINT 0, state)
        )
        else ...</pre>

<p>The simplest item to process is when Quit is selected.&nbsp; We process it in almost
the same way as we process WM_CLOSE, except in this case we have to explicitly call
DestroyWindow since the default action for this message is to do nothing.&nbsp; Note that
since we process WM_NCDESTROY by calling PostQuitMessage the message loop in
RunApplication will exit when the window destruction is complete.</p>

<h3><a name="Sending">5. Sending Messages</a></h3>

<p>So far we have seen how we process messages but not how our application can send them.
&nbsp; An application sends messages using either <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#SendMessage">SendMessage</a> or <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#PostMessage">PostMessage</a>. &nbsp; The main difference between
them is that SendMessage does not return until the window procedure has processed the
message and so it is able to return a result to the caller.&nbsp; It functions essentially
as a, possibly remote, procedure call.</p>

<p>We can use SendMessage to process some of the menu items.</p>

<pre>        else if wId = menuCut
        then (SendMessage(edit, WM_CUT); (LRESINT 0, state))
        else if wId = menuCopy
        then (SendMessage(edit, WM_COPY); (LRESINT 0, state))
        else if wId = menuPaste
        then (SendMessage(edit, WM_PASTE); (LRESINT 0, state))</pre>

<p>The Cut, Copy and Paste items from the edit menu are handled by sending messages to the
edit window.&nbsp; The edit window processes these by copying data to and from the
clipboard.&nbsp; In this example we are not interested in the result that SendMessage
returns but we use it rather than PostMessage to ensure that the command is fully
processed before, for example, we accept any characters as input.</p>

<p>Another case where we can use SendMessage is to see whether the text has been modified
and so whether we need to save it before quitting.</p>

<pre>fun checkForSave(hw, edit, fileName) =
    case SendMessage(edit, EM_GETMODIFY) of
            LRESINT 0 =&gt; true (* Unmodified - continue. *)
        |    _ =&gt; ... (* Save it. *)</pre>

<p>We send the edit window an EM_GETMODIFY message.&nbsp; If the reply is LRESINT 0 (i.e.
false) it has not been modified and we don't need to do anything.&nbsp; Otherwise we need
to save the document, or at least ask whether we should save it.</p>

<h3><a name="Dialogues">6. Dialogues</a></h3>

<p>A dialogue box is a special kind of window which is used to present information to the
user or to request information.&nbsp; They contain one or more <em>controls</em> and a
button usually labelled OK and often a Cancel button.&nbsp; The simplest form of dialogue
is the <em>message box</em>.&nbsp; This presents a piece of text and has one or more
buttons. &nbsp; </p>

<pre>let
    val res =
        MessageBox(SOME hw, &quot;Save document?&quot;, &quot;Confirm&quot;,
                   MessageBoxStyle.MB_YESNOCANCEL)
in
    if res = IDYES
    then .... (* Save document. *)  ...
    else if res = IDNO
    then true (* Continue anyway. *)
    else false (* Cancel - don't exit or open. *)
end</pre>

<p>We use a message box in mlEdit to ask whether we should save the document if it has
been modifed.&nbsp; The MB_YESNOCANCEL value for the style means that the message box will
have three buttons: Yes, No and Cancel.&nbsp; The message box is an example of a <em>modal</em>
dialogue.&nbsp; Modal dialogues are those which need a response before the application can
continue.&nbsp; The application is disabled until the dialogue has been dismissed by
clicking one of the buttons.&nbsp; In contrast a modeless dialogue acts just like another
window and the user can interact with either the application window or the dialogue box.
&nbsp; <a href="../WinRef/MessageBox.html#MessageBox">MessageBox</a> returns with an
identifier which indicates the button which was pressed. &nbsp; If Yes, we need to save
the document; if no, we don't.&nbsp; If Cancel was pressed we need to cancel the operation
which caused this dialogue to be presented.&nbsp; For instance, if the user accidentally
clicked on the Close box of the window and then pressed Cancel we do not pass the WM_CLOSE
message to the default window procedure.&nbsp; It is good interface design practice to
provide some way for the user to cancel an action.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated dialogue is used when the user selects &quot;About mlEdit...&quot;
from the Help menu.&nbsp; MessageBox is not sufficient for this dialogue since we want to
include an icon in the dialogue box so we use one of the general dialogue functions.
&nbsp; The layout of a dialogue can be given either in a <em>resource file</em> or as a <em>template</em>.
&nbsp; Resource files are often a convenient way of holding dialogues as well as menus and
other strings.&nbsp; They lend themselves particularly to producing <em>localized</em>
versions of programs, i.e. programs with the user interaction tailored for a particular
language and/or culture, since all the text that needs to be localized can be stored in
the resource file.&nbsp; A resource file is either an executable file (.EXE) or a dynamic
library (.DLL).&nbsp; To use a resource file you will need a suitable resource compiler
which will normally form part of a development environment such as Microsoft Visual C or
Borland C++.&nbsp; You can then load the resource file and get a handle to it using <a href="../WinRef/Resource.html#LoadLibrary">LoadLibrary</a>.&nbsp; It is possible to make use
of resources in the Poly/ML program using the instance handle returned by <a href="../WinRef/Globals.html#ApplicationInstance">ApplicationInstance</a>.&nbsp; We actually
do this in mlEdit to get a handle to the icon.</p>

<pre>(* Borrow the Poly icon from the application program. It happens to be icon id 102. *)
val polyIcon = Icon.LoadIcon(app, Resource.MAKEINTRESOURCE 102);</pre>

<p>For this example, though, we use a template for the dialogue.</p>

<pre>val pictureId = 1000 (* Could use any number here. *)
open Static.Style
val template =
    {x = 0, y = 0, cx = 210, cy = 94, font = SOME (8, &quot;MS Sans Serif&quot;), menu = NONE,
     class = NONE, title = &quot;About mlEdit&quot;, extendedStyle = 0,
     style = flags[WS_POPUP, WS_CAPTION],

     items =
      [{x = 73, y = 62, cx = 50, cy = 14, id = 1,
        class = DLG_BUTTON (flags[WS_CHILD, WS_VISIBLE, WS_TABSTOP]),
        title = DLG_TITLESTRING &quot;OK&quot;, creationData = NONE, extendedStyle = 0},

       {x = 7, y = 7, cx = 32, cy = 32, id = pictureId,
        class = DLG_STATIC (flags[WS_CHILD, WS_VISIBLE, SS_ICON]),
        title = DLG_TITLESTRING &quot;&quot;, creationData = NONE, extendedStyle = 0},

       {x = 15, y = 39, cx = 180, cy = 21, id = 65535,
        class = DLG_STATIC (flags[WS_CHILD, WS_VISIBLE, WS_GROUP]),
        title = DLG_TITLESTRING
               &quot;mlEdit - An exmple of Windows programming in Poly/ML\
               \\nCopyright David C.J. Matthews 2001&quot;,
        creationData = NONE,  extendedStyle = 0}] }</pre>

<p>The dialogue contains three items: a button with the title &quot;OK&quot;, 
  a static picture with style SS_ICON, and a piece of static text.&nbsp; Along 
  with the layout of the dialogue we also need a dialogue procedure.&nbsp; A dialogue 
  procedure is almost the same as a window procedure.&nbsp; It processes messages 
  sent to the dialogue in the same way as a window procedure does.&nbsp;The only 
  difference is that a dialogue procedure does not call DefWindowProc.</p>

<pre>fun dlgProc(dial, WM_INITDIALOG _, ()) =
    (
        (* Send a message to the picture control to set it to this icon. *)
        SendMessage(GetDlgItem(dial, pictureId), STM_SETICON{icon=polyIcon});
        (LRESINT 1, ())
    )

|    dlgProc(dial, WM_COMMAND{notifyCode = 0, wId=1 (* OK button *), ...}, ()) =
        (* When the OK button is pressed we end the dialogue. *)
        (EndDialog(dial, 1); (LRESINT 1, ()) )

|    dlgProc _ = (LRESINT 0, ())</pre>

<p>We only process two messages here: WM_INITDIALOG and WM_COMMAND.&nbsp; WM_INITDIALOG is
sent when the dialogue is created.&nbsp; We use GetDlgItem to get a handle to the static
picture control and then send it a STM_SETICON message to set the picture.&nbsp; We only
need to do this when the dialogue is initialised.&nbsp; The static control will take care
of displaying the picture whenever the dialogue box is visible.&nbsp; WM_COMMAND messages
are sent by buttons as well as by menus and in this example we process the message by
calling EndDialog to close the dialogue box.&nbsp; The value of wId in this case is the
identifier of the OK button.</p>

<p>To construct and display the dialogue box we call DialogBoxIndirect with the template
and the dialogue procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parent of the dialogue is our main window
(hw).&nbsp; This window will automatically be disabled until the dialogue box has been
closed.</p>

<pre>DialogBoxIndirect(app, template, hw, dlgProc, ());</pre>

<h3><a name="Common">7. Common Dialogues</a></h3>

<p>For many purposes a standard dialogue box can be used and Windows provides a number of
these.&nbsp; For instance, most applications include a way for the user to open a file and
it would be tedious to have to program this from scratch for each new application. &nbsp;
It is far easier to use a standard dialogue.&nbsp; More to the point, by using a standard
dialogue the interface to the user is similar to that of other applications, reducing the
learning load.</p>

<p>The mlEdit example uses a number of these.&nbsp; <a href="../WinRef/CommonDialog.html#GetOpenFileName">GetOpenFileName</a> and <a href="../WinRef/CommonDialog.html#GetSaveFileName">GetSaveFileName</a> are used to select the
file to open and for the Save As menu item.&nbsp; <a href="../WinRef/CommonDialog.html#FindText">FindText</a> is used for the Find menu item.
&nbsp; <a href="../WinRef/CommonDialog.html#PageSetupDlg">PageSetupDlg</a> and <a href="../WinRef/CommonDialog.html#PrintDlg">PrintDlg</a> are used for the Page Setup and
Print items.&nbsp; They generally work in the same way, creating a modal dialogue
requesting the information and returning when the OK or Cancel button is pressed. &nbsp;
The ML functions take a configuration structure and return an option type.&nbsp; If the
user cancels the operation they return NONE, if the user presses OK they return a new
configuration structure with the requested information filled in. FindText works
differently.&nbsp; It creates a modeless dialogue and instead sends <a href="../WinRef/Message.html#FINDMSGSTRING">FINDMSGSTRING</a> messages to the parent window.</p>

<h3><a name="Printing">8. Printing and Painting</a></h3>

<p>One area we have not touched on is actually how we draw to the screen.&nbsp; By using
the Edit window to draw the text our application does not actually need to concern itself
with exactly what happens when an area of the screen is uncovered and how characters in
the text are converted into dots on the screen.&nbsp; This is all dealt with by the Edit
window class.</p>

<p>When it comes to printing the file these issues become apparent.&nbsp; Printing to a
printer and drawing to the screen are handled in exactly the same way in Windows.&nbsp; In
both cases we need to draw the document into a <em>device context</em>.&nbsp; A device
context is an abstraction used for printers, the screen and also for <em>bitmaps</em> and <em>metafiles</em>
in memory.&nbsp; Although there is an obvious difference in the printed page and an image
on the screen in terms of the physical output as far as preparing the image is concerned
they are both rectangular areas of dots (<em>pixels</em>).&nbsp; They may differ in size,
in the range of colours possible and in the number of pixels per inch (<em>resolution</em>).
&nbsp; Since we don't need to be concerned with drawing to the screen in this application
we will focus on printing the file but we could easily arrange the code so that it could
be used for both.</p>

<p>We get a device context for the printer by giving the PrintDlgFlags.PD_RETURNDC option
to the print dialogue.&nbsp; It would also be possible to get a device context using
CreateDC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we have the device context we can find the size of the page.</p>

<pre>val _ = SetMapMode(hdc, MM_TEXT)
val pageWidth = GetDeviceCaps(hdc, HORZRES)
and pageHeight = GetDeviceCaps(hdc, VERTRES)</pre>

<p>We now need to find a font to use.&nbsp; We want a 10 point Courier font which we
obtain using <a href="../WinRef/Font.html#CreateFont">CreateFont</a>.&nbsp; This is a fixed
width font which simplifies calculating the page width.</p>

<pre>val charHeight = ~10 * GetDeviceCaps(hdc, LOGPIXELSY) div 72;
val hFont = CreateFont{height=charHeight, width=0, escapement=0, orientation=0,
       weight=FW_DONTCARE, italic=false, underline=false, strikeOut=false,
       charSet=ANSI_CHARSET, outputPrecision=OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS,
       clipPrecision=CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS, quality=DEFAULT_QUALITY,
       pitch=FIXED_PITCH, family=FF_MODERN, faceName=&quot;Courier&quot;}</pre>

<p>The character height calculation looks odd, giving us a negative value, but is a
pecularity of CreateFont.&nbsp; All the other arguments are fairly obvious.&nbsp; </p>

<pre>val oldFont = SelectObject(hdc, hFont);

val textMetric = GetTextMetrics hdc;</pre>

<p>We now select this as the font to use.&nbsp; <a href="../WinRef/DeviceContext.html#SelectObject">SelectObject</a> can be used for various
other sorts of object, such as pens, brushes and bitmaps.&nbsp; Whenever you select in a
particularly kind of object the previous object of that kind is returned as the result.
&nbsp; It's generally good practice to select it back before you finish with a device
context.&nbsp; Having selected this font we then call <a href="../WinRef/Font.html#GetTextMetrics">GetTextMetrics</a> to find the width of the font.
&nbsp; From this and the page width we can compute the number of characters on a line.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The height of the page divided by the height of a character gives us the
number of characters on a page.&nbsp; We are now ready to print a page.</p>

<p>We get the text from the edit window using <a href="../WinRef/Window.html#GetWindowText">GetWindowText</a>.
&nbsp; The print dialogue gives the user the option of printing the currently selected
area of the window rather than the whole file or a range of pages.&nbsp; To find the
selection we send the edit window an EM_GETSEL message.</p>

<p>We prepare the page by setting the colours and filling the page with white.&nbsp; These
are likely to be the defaults anyway but there's no harm in making sure.</p>

<pre>val white = RGB{red=255, blue=255, green=255}
val black = RGB{red=0, blue=0, green = 0}
val pageRect = {top=0, left=0, bottom=pageHeight, right=pageWidth}

SetBkColor(hdc, white);
SetTextColor(hdc, black);
ExtTextOut(hdc, {x=0, y=0}, [ETO_OPAQUE], SOME pageRect, &quot;&quot;, []);</pre>

<p><a href="../WinRef/Font.html#ExtTextOut">ExtTextOut</a> is one of the ways of drawing text
but it is also a convenient way of filling an area with a colour.&nbsp; The ETO_OPAQUE
option causes the rectangle to be filled with the background colour.</p>

<p>Actually drawing each line is done using the <a href="../WinRef/Font.html#TabbedTextOut">TabbedTextOut</a>
function.&nbsp; We extract a line from the document and draw it .</p>

<pre>TabbedTextOut(hdc, {x=0, y= lineNo * #height textMetric},  thisLine, [], 0);</pre>

<p>Each line is drawn beneath the previous one until the page is full or we have drawn all
the text.</p>

<p>All this is the same whether we are printing a file or drawing to the screen. &nbsp;
When printing, though there are a few extra function calls we need.&nbsp; Before each page
we call <a href="../WinRef/Printing.html#StartPage">StartPage</a> and after the page we call <a href="../WinRef/Printing.html#EndPage">EndPage</a>.&nbsp; We also need to bracket the whole
document with calls to <a href="../WinRef/Printing.html#StartDoc">StartDoc</a> and <a href="../WinRef/Printing.html#EndDoc">EndDoc</a>.&nbsp; When the document is complete we also
need to restore the original font, delete the Courier font we created and delete the
device context.</p>

<pre>val jobID = StartDoc(hdc, {docName=fileName, output=NONE, dType=NONE});
...
EndDoc hdc;
SelectObject(hdc, oldFont);
DeleteObject hFont;
DeleteDC hdc;</pre>

<p>We could use this code to draw to the screen if we were not using the edit 
  window. &nbsp; In that case we would process the WM_PAINT message and bracket 
  the calls with <a href="../WinRef/Painting.html#BeginPaint">BeginPaint</a> and 
  <a href="../WinRef/Painting.html#EndPaint">EndPaint</a>.</p>
