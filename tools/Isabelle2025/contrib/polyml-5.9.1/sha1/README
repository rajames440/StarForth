  SHA1 library

The SHA1 algorithm computes a 160 bit checksum for arbitrary strings.
This implementation of SHA1 is taken from the GNU coreutils package,
version 8.4.  More precisely, the following files where copied without
modification:

  COPYING
  sha1.c
  sha1.h

The file "config.h", holding the configuration options obtain from the
coreutils build process is intentionally left empty here.  All other
files have been written for building and testing the SHA1 library.

The license of coreutils also applies to this derived work.



  Building the SHA1 library

Running the "build" script without arguments prints a list of
supported platforms.  Running the "build" script with one of the
supported platforms as argument builds the SHA1 library for that
platform.
