Poly/ML for Isabelle
====================

This compilation of Poly/ML (https://www.polyml.org) is based on the
source distribution from
https://github.com/polyml/polyml/commit/90c0dbb2514e

This coincides with the official release of Poly/ML 5.9.1, see also
https://github.com/polyml/polyml/releases/tag/v5.9.1

The Isabelle repository provides an administrative tool "isabelle
component_polyml", which can be used in the polyml component directory as
follows:

* Linux and macOS

  $ isabelle component_polyml

* Windows (Cygwin shell)

  $ isabelle component_polyml -M /cygdrive/c/msys64


Building libgmp on macOS
========================

The build_polyml invocations above implicitly use the GNU Multiple Precision
Arithmetic Library (libgmp), but that is not available on macOS by default.
Appending "--without-gmp" to the command-line omits this library. Building
libgmp properly from sources works as follows (library headers and binaries
will be placed in /usr/local).

* Download:

  $ curl https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.3.0.tar.bz2 | tar xjf -
  $ cd gmp-6.3.0

* build:

  $ make distclean

  #Intel
  $ ./configure --enable-cxx --build=core2-apple-darwin"$(uname -r)"

  #ARM
  $ ./configure --enable-cxx --build=aarch64-apple-darwin"$(uname -r)"

  $ make && make check
  $ sudo make install
