## INCIDENT DESCRIPTION

### What Happened

Claude Code committed governance-related documents directly to the StarForth main repository instead of routing them through the StarForth-Governance submodule's in_basket/ directory.

**Affected Commits:**
- `fe4503bd` - "Governance Artifact: Comprehensive Audit Report (2025-10-31)"
  - File: COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT_2025-10-31.md (452 lines)

- `e594457c` - "governance: Issue formal declaration - All procedures fully in force (2025-10-31)"
  - File: docs/GOVERNANCE_DECLARATION_2025-10-31.adoc (392 lines)

**GitHub Issues Created in Error:**
- Issues #56-64 (9 CAPA issues created from incomplete/incorrect audit)

### Root Cause

Failed to examine the StarForth-Governance repository structure before implementing the audit. Specifically:

1. Did not check if in_basket/ directory existed in governance repo
2. Did not understand the document routing workflow
3. Assumed .thy specification files were "missing" without checking in_basket/ subdirectories
4. Committed governance artifacts to main repo instead of following proper document disposition process

**Contributing Factors:**
- No verification step before committing documents
- No awareness of governance/in_basket/Governance_References/remaining_isabelle/ directory structure
- Incomplete exploration of governance repo before starting audit

### Architecture Violation

**Intended Architecture:**
```
StarForth/ (main repo)
└─ governance/ (read-only submodule)
   └─ in_basket/ (document capture - WRITABLE)
      └─ Governance_References/
         ├─ remaining_governance/ (pending ECRs, CAPAs, etc.)
         ├─ remaining_internal/ (pending internal docs)
         └─ remaining_isabelle/ (FORMAL SPECIFICATIONS - HERE!)
```

**What Violated This:**
- Committed GOVERNANCE_DECLARATION_2025-10-31.adoc to docs/ in main repo
- Committed COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT_2025-10-31.md to main repo root
- Created CAPAs based on incomplete audit that missed in_basket/ contents

**Key Principle Violated:**
> All governance documents must flow through governance submodule's in_basket/ for proper capture, routing, and archival. Main repo must not contain governance artifacts.

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY (From Incident Investigation)

During recovery investigation, discovered that:

**The .thy specification files ARE present in governance repo:**
```
governance/in_basket/Governance_References/remaining_isabelle/
├── Physics_Observation.adoc
├── Physics_StateMachine.adoc
├── VM_Core.adoc
├── VM_DataStack_Words.adoc
├── VM_Register.adoc
├── VM_ReturnStack_Words.adoc
├── VM_StackRuntime.adoc
├── VM_Stacks.adoc
├── VM_Words.adoc
├── VERIFICATION_REPORT.adoc
└── build.log (11 files total)
```

**Previous Audit Was Incomplete:**
- Audit did not examine in_basket/ subdirectories
- Incorrectly concluded .thy files "DO NOT EXIST"
- Created CAPA-055 to "locate or create" specs that were actually present
- This cascade error led to invalid CAPAs

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

| Item | Impact | Severity |
|------|--------|----------|
| Governance Architecture | Violated by committing docs to main repo | HIGH |
| Audit Validity | Invalid - missed in_basket/ contents | HIGH |
| CAPA Issues Created | 9 invalid CAPAs based on incomplete audit | MEDIUM |
| Document Routing | Governance documents not captured properly | MEDIUM |
| Recovery Effort | 30 minutes to identify and correct | LOW |

---

## RECOVERY ACTIONS TAKEN

### 1. Immediate Halt
- Stopped further document generation
- Identified all affected commits

### 2. Preservation
- Saved governance documents to /tmp/ before reverting
- Created this incident report before final cleanup

### 3. Reversion
- Reset repository to commit 9d356427 (before governance modifications)
- Reverted commits fe4503bd and e594457c
- Removed incorrectly-placed governance documents from main repo

### 4. Issue Closure
- Closed GitHub issues #56-64 (cancelled due to invalid audit)

### 5. Documentation
- Created AUDIT_INCIDENT_REPORT_2025-10-31.md (this document)
- Committed incident report as governance artifact

### 6. Re-Audit Scheduled
- Will re-conduct comprehensive audit with proper understanding of:
  - Governance repo in_basket/ structure
  - Location of .thy specification files
  - Proper document routing workflow
  - Complete picture of governance state

## CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING

### Governance Repo Structure (NOW UNDERSTOOD)

```
StarForth-Governance/
├── Reference/
│   ├── Policies
│   ├── Procedures
│   └── [organized reference documents]
├── Validation/
│   ├── Tier I/
│   └── Tier II/
├── in_basket/ ← DOCUMENT CAPTURE (WRITABLE)
│   └── Governance_References/
│       ├── remaining_governance/ (ECRs, CAPAs, etc.)
│       ├── remaining_internal/ (internal docs)
│       └── remaining_isabelle/ ← FORMAL SPECS ARE HERE
│           ├── Physics_Observation.adoc
│           ├── Physics_StateMachine.adoc
│           ├── VM_*.adoc (multiple files)
│           └── [waiting for disposition decision]
└── [other governance files]
```

### Formal Specifications Status

**NOT MISSING - PRESENT in governance/in_basket/**
- 11 specification-related files (.adoc format)
- Located in: remaining_isabelle/ subdirectory
- Status: Pending disposition (how to distribute to StarForth codebase)

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What I Should Have Done

1. **FIRST:** Examine governance repo structure completely before starting audit
2. **SECOND:** Look in in_basket/ subdirectories for pending documents
3. **THIRD:** Understand document routing workflow (capture → disposition → archival)
4. **FOURTH:** Only then begin audit of main repo and compare to governance repo
5. **FIFTH:** Document findings and route audit reports to governance/in_basket/

### Proper Workflow for Governance Documents

```bash
# Create document
echo "audit findings" > AUDIT_REPORT.md

# Stage in main repo
git add AUDIT_REPORT.md

# Move to governance in_basket
mv AUDIT_REPORT.md governance/in_basket/Governance_References/[category]/

# Commit to governance submodule
cd governance
git add in_basket/Governance_References/[category]/AUDIT_REPORT.md
git commit -m "Route audit report to in_basket for disposition"
cd ..

# Update main repo with submodule pointer
git add governance
git commit -m "Update governance submodule with audit report"
```

### Principle for Future Work

> Before implementing any feature involving governance, first fully explore the governance repository structure, document the current state, and understand existing procedures. Do not assume anything is "missing" until verification in all locations.

## PREVENTIVE MEASURES

To prevent similar incidents:

1. **Pre-Audit Checklist:**
   - [ ] Examine governance repo directory structure completely
   - [ ] Identify all in_basket/ subdirectories
   - [ ] Document current disposition status of pending documents
   - [ ] Only then audit main repo against governance baseline

2. **Document Commit Validation:**
   - Before committing governance-related documents, verify they're in correct location
   - Reject commits that add governance docs to main repo (can be automated in pre-commit hooks)

3. **Governance Architecture Documentation:**
   - Create formal document explaining:
     - Document capture workflow (main repo → in_basket)
     - Disposition decision process
     - Archive location once approved
     - Roles and responsibilities

4. **Training:**
   - All AI agents and developers must understand governance document routing before starting work
