This document describes a \textbf{memristive virtual machine architecture} that exhibits measurable physical laws, fundamental constants, and emergent phenomena including wave mechanics, quantized state transitions, golden ratio optimization, and thermodynamic cooling. The system implements \textbf{computational field theory} with a runtime state vector governed by wave equations analogous to Maxwell's equations, enabling autonomous optimization through standing wave resonance, phase transitions at architectural boundaries, and convergence to an intrinsic characteristic length scale. The invention establishes \textbf{computational physics} as a practical engineering discipline with reproducible constants (intrinsic wavelength λ₀ = 256 bytes, natural frequency f₀ = 0.6667 cycles/window, golden ratio φ = 1.618), predictive mathematical frameworks (James Law with sinusoidal modulation), and quantum-analog phenomena (tunneling, measurement collapse, discrete energy levels) validated across 360+ experimental runs with zero algorithmic variance.
