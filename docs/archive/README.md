# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer current but preserved for reference and context.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**Information in this directory may be outdated, superseded, or incorrect.**

Always consult current documentation in the numbered directories (`../01-getting-started/`, `../03-architecture/`, etc.) before referencing archived materials.

## Contents

### phase-1/
Development artifacts from Phase 1 (initial VM + physics implementation):
- `Reference/` - Implementation summaries, testing results, phase completion status
- `Reference/physics_experiment/` - Experimental iteration, DoE analysis
- `Reference/physics_experiment/PEER_REVIEW_SUBMISSION/` - Initial peer review materials

**Note:** Much of Phase 1 content has been superseded by:
- Current architecture docs: `../03-architecture/`
- Current experiment protocols: `../02-experiments/`
- Current quality processes: `../04-quality/`

### Top-Level Archived Files

- **START_HERE_HEARTBEAT_DOE.md** - Superseded by `../02-experiments/heartbeat-doe/`
- **OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md** - Superseded by `../03-architecture/physics-engine/`

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

Archived documentation provides:
- **Historical context** for design decisions
- **Evolution of ideas** over time
- **Lessons learned** from failed approaches
- **Reference** for "why we don't do X anymore"

## When to Consult Archive

✅ **Good reasons to check archive:**
- Understanding historical design rationale
- Researching "why did we try approach X?"
- Comparing old vs. new implementation
- Finding context for git blame results

❌ **Bad reasons to check archive:**
- Learning how to use StarForth (use `../01-getting-started/`)
- Understanding current architecture (use `../03-architecture/`)
- Running experiments (use `../02-experiments/`)
- Contributing code (use `../CONTRIBUTING.md`)

## For Researchers

The archive provides valuable insight into:
- Development process evolution
- Experimental methodology development
- Design trade-offs and decisions
- Failed approaches and why they failed
