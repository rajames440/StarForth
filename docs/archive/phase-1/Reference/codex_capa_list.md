| CAPA-37 | F-37 | Major | Published run log lacks metadata required for reproducibility. | Raw CLI output archived
without governance template. | Recreate test log with header (platform, commit, tester, timestamp, pass/fail summary). |
Standardize log export tooling and enforce via CI. | Validation Engineer | 2025-11-08 | Open |
| CAPA-38 | F-38 | Major | Deficiency transparency rule cites an empty template as evidence. | Deficiency logging
process never initiated. | Populate deficiency log with actual counts/status; link from Tier I report. | Integrate
deficiency log maintenance into release-go/no-go checklist. | Maintainer | 2025-11-09 | Open |
| CAPA-39 | F-39 | Major | Foundational policies/processes marked active but remain unsigned. | Signature workflow not
executed post-migration. | Secure signatures for each policy/process and update tracker. | Adopt automated
reminders/escalations for pending signatures. | Maintainer | 2025-11-18 | Open |
| CAPA-40 | F-40 | Major | Governance roadmap and CAPA logs retain `[TBD]` roles/status, creating circular
dependencies. | Ownership assignments deferred; logs left as templates. | Assign named owners/reviewers, record current
status for defect and refinement logs. | Embed owner assignment into process rollout guidance and audit monthly. |

| CAPA-41 | F-41 | Major | Continuous validation policy lacks supporting CI evidence. | CI artifacts not exported into
governance repo. | Document existing CI pipelines, capture recent execution reports, and place under evidence catalog. |
Automate routine export of CI run summaries at each release gate. | DevOps Lead | 2025-11-19 | Open |
| CAPA-42 | F-42 | Major | Automated quality standards (ISO 5055/NIST SSDF) lack supporting SonarQube or static-analysis
evidence. | Quality gate relies only on compiler warnings. | Stand up SonarQube (or equivalent) analysis for StarForth,
archive reports in governance repo, and reference results in Tier II documentation. | Integrate SonarQube scan into CI
and add report export step to release process. | DevOps Lead | 2025-11-26 | Open |
