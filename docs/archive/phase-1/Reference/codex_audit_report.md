# StarForth Governance – Fresh Audit Report

**Auditor:** Codex (independent reviewer)  
**Audit Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)  
**Scope:** StarForth-Governance repository – governance controls, validation evidence, and release gating artifacts.

## Methodology

- Read core governance statements (`GOVERNANCE.md`, `README.md`, `VALIDATION_BOOK.adoc`).
- Sampled Tier I and Tier II validation artifacts, evidence logs, and signature registers.
- Verified claimed evidence by inspecting referenced files and checking for required outputs.
- Logged every gap found (no legacy findings reused) until 34 distinct nonconformities were captured.

## Overall Assessment

Major release gates (platform validation, coverage proof, and process approvals) remain unsatisfied. With 34 open
nonconformities spanning evidence, validation records, and governance sign-offs, **StarForth-Governance is not
audit-ready**. Remediation must close each finding with objective evidence and documented approvals before a follow-up
audit.

| F-36 | Major    | `Validation/TIER_I_FOUNDATION/PROTOCOLS/PROTOCOL_FORTH79_COMPLIANCE.adoc:60-125`; `Validation/TIER_I_FOUNDATION/TEST_RESULTS/TEST_RESULTS_LOG.adoc:62-105`                      | Protocol demands archived x86_64 and ARM64 logs, but the ledger cites `starforth-test-arm64-[date].log (ARCHIVED)` without the file existing, so the governance pack simultaneously requires and lacks the proof.                    |
