== Discussion

=== Implications for Formal Verification

[TODO: How variance decomposition enables formal verification. Physics model is formally verifiable independent of environment.]

=== Comparison with Existing Approaches

[TODO: How this compares to JIT, ML-based optimization, traditional DVFS.]

=== Limitations

[TODO: Discuss Fibonacci workload limitations, single-threaded assumption, applicability boundaries.]

=== Future Work

[TODO: Validation on real FORTH code, ML-assisted tuning, hybrid approaches.]

=== Deployment Considerations

[TODO: Service level agreements, performance guarantees, practical integration.]
