# Session Logs

Historical development session summaries preserved for context and reference.

## Purpose

These are **informal notes** from development sessions, documenting:
- Long debugging sessions with significant findings
- Experimental iterations and design decisions
- Development context and rationale
- Dead-ends and lessons learned

## When to Create Session Logs

✅ **Do create session logs for:**
- Multi-hour debugging sessions with important discoveries
- Experimental work with multiple failed attempts before success
- Design discussions that made important architectural decisions
- Complex refactoring with non-obvious rationale

❌ **Don't create session logs for:**
- Routine development (use git commit messages instead)
- Formal documentation (use appropriate numbered directory)
- Final implementation details (use architecture docs)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Session logs are archival and may contain outdated information**

- Always consult current documentation first
- Information here reflects the state at the time of writing
- Design decisions may have been revised
- Code examples may be superseded

## Contents

- **2025-11-20-recap.md** - Development recap session
- **2025-11-26-worklog.md** - Work log summary
- **experimental-addendum.md** - Experimental work notes
- **experimental-iteration-usage.md** - Iteration notes
- **serialized-questing-pike.md** - Design exploration notes

## Relationship to Formal Documentation

Session logs supplement formal documentation but don't replace it:

| Session Logs | Formal Documentation |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Informal notes | Structured guides |
| Point-in-time snapshots | Maintained and current |
| Developer perspective | User/maintainer perspective |
| Context and rationale | How-to and reference |

## For Current Developers

If you're looking for information:

1. **Check formal docs first:** `../01-getting-started/`, `../03-architecture/`, etc.
2. **Search session logs** if you need historical context
3. **Update formal docs** if you find valuable information only in session logs

## For Historical Research

Session logs provide valuable insight into:
- Development process and methodology
- Design evolution over time
- Challenges faced and solutions developed
- Team decision-making rationale
