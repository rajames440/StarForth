This glossary provides precise definitions for terminology used throughout this work. Terms are organized alphabetically with cross-references where applicable.

=== Core Concepts

[glossary]
Adaptive Heartbeat::
    Time-driven coordination mechanism that orchestrates feedback loop execution at dynamically-adjusted intervals. The heartbeat thread executes `vm_tick()` at frequency stem:[f_{\text{tick}}], where stem:[f_{\text{tick}} \in [f_{\text{min}}, f_{\text{max}}]] adapts based on system stability metrics.
    +
    *Measurement*: Tick period in nanoseconds (configurable via `HEARTBEAT_TICK_NS`).
    +
    *Implementation*: Background pthread executing `heartbeat_thread_main()`.

Attractor::
    Stable equilibrium point or region in phase space toward which execution trajectories converge. Formally, a fixed point stem:[\mathbf{x}^*] where stem:[F(\mathbf{x}^*) = \mathbf{x}^*] for dynamical system stem:[\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = F(\mathbf{x}_t)].
    +
    *Measurement*: Coordinates in stem:[(w, \lambda, \sigma^2)] phase space.
    +
    *Empirical observation*: StarForth exhibits stable fixed-point attractor across 90 experimental runs.

Coefficient of Variation (CV)::
    Normalized measure of dispersion, defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}
    ++++
    +
    *Convergence criterion*: stem:[CV \to 0] indicates deterministic convergence.
    +
    *Application*: Used to quantify variance reduction in steady-state metrics.

Decay Coefficient (λ)::
    Rate parameter controlling exponential reduction in execution frequency over time. Units: stem:[[1/\text{time}]].
    +
    *Mathematical model*:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    f(t) = f_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}
    ++++
    +
    *Measurement*: Derived via exponential regression on rolling window data; stored as Q48.16 fixed-point.
    +
    *Typical range*: stem:[\lambda \in [10^{-6}, 10^{-3}]] per microsecond.

Deterministic Convergence::
    Property whereby repeated executions of identical workloads produce statistically indistinguishable steady-state metrics. Formally:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    \forall \text{ executions } i,j: \quad \frac{|\text{metric}_i - \text{metric}_j|}{\sigma} < \epsilon
    ++++
    +
    where stem:[\epsilon \to 0] as stem:[t \to \infty].
    +
    *Empirical result*: 0% algorithmic variance across 90 runs (CV < 0.001%).
    +
    *Significance*: Enables reproducible performance characterization.

Execution Frequency::
    Count of times a dictionary entry has been executed since VM initialization, optionally adjusted by temporal decay. This is the *primary measurable quantity* in the adaptive runtime.
    +
    *Mathematical representation*:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    f = \sum \text{executions} - \int \text{decay}(t) \, dt
    ++++
    +
    *Implementation*: Unsigned 64-bit integer (`uint64_t execution_heat`).
    +
    *Note*: "Heat" is metaphorical naming convention; actual quantity is execution count.

Exponential Decay::
    Mathematical function modeling reduction in execution frequency proportional to current value:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    f(t) = f_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}
    ++++
    +
    where stem:[f_0] is initial frequency and stem:[\lambda] is decay coefficient.
    +
    *Physical analogy*: Similar to radioactive decay or thermal dissipation (metaphor only).
    +
    *Application*: Applied periodically by heartbeat system to reduce stale frequency counts.

Feedback Loop::
    Self-referential process where system output influences future input. Classified as:
    +
    * *Positive* (amplifying): Output reinforces input
    * *Negative* (stabilizing): Output opposes input
    * *Neutral* (monitoring): No direct influence
    +
    *Example*: Loop #1 (Execution Heat Tracking) is positive feedback:
    +
    ----
    Execution → Frequency↑ → Cache Rank↑ → Lookup Speed↑ → More Execution
    ----

Hot-Words Cache::
    Fixed-size array storing pointers to the stem:[K] most frequently executed dictionary entries, enabling O(1) lookup acceleration.
    +
    *Selection criterion*:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    e \in \text{Cache} \iff \text{rank}(e) \leq K
    ++++
    +
    where stem:[\text{rank}(e) = |\{e' \in \text{Dictionary} : f(e') > f(e)\}| + 1].
    +
    *Performance impact*: Reduces average lookup time by 70-95% (workload-dependent).

Levene's Test::
    Non-parametric statistical test for homogeneity of variance across groups. Tests null hypothesis stem:[H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2 = \cdots = \sigma_k^2] (equal variances).
    +
    *Test statistic*: F-statistic with associated p-value.
    +
    *Application*: Used in window width inference (Loop #5) to detect variance changes when adjusting window size.
    +
    *Decision threshold*: Typically stem:[\alpha = 0.05] (5% significance level).

Phase Space::
    Multi-dimensional coordinate system where each axis represents a system state variable. For StarForth:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    \mathcal{S} = \{(w, \lambda, \sigma^2) \mid w \in \mathbb{N}, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}^+, \sigma^2 \in \mathbb{R}^+\}
    ++++
    +
    *Dimensions*:
    * stem:[w]: Window size (execution events retained)
    * stem:[\lambda]: Decay slope (frequency reduction rate)
    * stem:[\sigma^2]: Variance (metric dispersion)
    +
    *Analysis technique*: Execution trajectories plotted in phase space reveal attractor basins.

Rolling Window of Truth::
    Circular buffer recording recent execution history for deterministic metric seeding. Guarantees identical initial conditions across runs.
    +
    *Data structure*: Ring buffer stem:[B[i] = \text{word\_id}] at execution event stem:[i \bmod |B|].
    +
    *Buffer size*: Configurable (default: `ROLLING_WINDOW_SIZE = 4096`).
    +
    *Purpose*: Enables reproducible variance calculations by providing consistent historical context.

Steady-State Equilibrium::
    Condition where adaptive system metrics stabilize within bounded oscillation. Formally:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    \exists t_0: \quad \forall t > t_0, \quad |x(t) - x^*| < \delta
    ++++
    +
    for small stem:[\delta].
    +
    *Empirical criterion*: Variance stem:[CV < 0.1\%] over 1000-tick window.
    +
    *Physical analogy*: Similar to thermodynamic equilibrium where macroscopic properties cease changing.

Thermodynamic Metaphor::
    Conceptual mapping between thermodynamic quantities and execution metrics. This is a *metaphorical framework*, not literal physics.
    +
    *Mappings*:
    * Heat stem:[\leftrightarrow] Execution Frequency
    * Temperature stem:[\leftrightarrow] Normalized Rank
    * Cooling stem:[\leftrightarrow] Exponential Decay
    * Equilibrium stem:[\leftrightarrow] Steady State
    +
    *Academic usage*: Must be qualified as metaphor in formal writing.

Transition Probability::
    Conditional probability that word stem:[B] is executed immediately after word stem:[A]. Maximum likelihood estimate:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    P(B|A) = \frac{\text{count}(A \to B)}{\text{count}(A)}
    ++++
    +
    *Implementation*: Stored as Q48.16 fixed-point in `transition_metrics` structure.
    +
    *Application*: Used for speculative execution (prefetching likely-next words).

Variance Inflection Point::
    Window size stem:[w^*] where variance begins to increase when window shrinks below stem:[w^*]. Represents optimal trade-off between sample size and temporal locality.
    +
    *Optimization objective*:
    +
    [stem]
    ++++
    w^* = \arg\min_{w \in [w_{\text{min}}, w_{\text{current}}]} \text{Var}(w)
    ++++
    +
    *Search method*: Binary search with Levene's test validation.
    +
    *Purpose*: Adaptive window size tuning (Loop #5).

=== Feedback Loop Taxonomy

=== Deprecated Terminology

The following terms should be *avoided* in formal academic writing:

[glossary]
"Physics-based optimization"::
    *Use instead*: "Thermodynamically-inspired metaphor for frequency decay"
    +
    *Reason*: Implies literal physics; actual implementation uses counters and exponential functions.

"Execution heat" (in formal context)::
    *Use instead*: "Execution frequency with temporal decay"
    +
    *Reason*: "Heat" is metaphorical; use precise term in academic writing.

"AI-driven" or "ML-based"::
    *Use instead*: "Statistically-inferred" or "Adaptive via Levene's test"
    +
    *Reason*: No neural networks or machine learning involved.

"Learning"::
    *Use instead*: "Adaptive inference" or "Parameter convergence"
    +
    *Reason*: Not supervised/unsupervised learning; statistical convergence.

"Quantum-inspired"::
    *Use instead*: N/A
    +
    *Reason*: No quantum mechanics or superposition involved.
