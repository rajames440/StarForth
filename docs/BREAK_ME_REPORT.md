## 🎉 EASTER EGG: THE STARFORTH CHALLENGE 🎉

```
     ⭐  C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S  ⭐

  You've discovered the hidden StarForth challenge!

  Your system just survived 779 exhaustive tests.
  But can YOU survive the ULTIMATE FORTH CHALLENGE?

  🏆 THE STARFORTH MASTER CHALLENGE 🏆

  Write a Forth program that:
  1. Prints the Fibonacci sequence up to 1000
  2. Uses ONLY the following words:
     : ; DUP OVER DROP SWAP . CR < IF THEN DO LOOP
  3. Fits in exactly 79 characters (FORTH-79 tribute!)

  Submit your solution to the StarForth community!

  Hint: Think recursively, but remember FORTH-79
        doesn't have RECURSE... 😉

  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  BONUS SECRET: If you ran --break-me, you're already
  in the top 1% of Forth enthusiasts. Welcome to the
  elite club! Your system just proved it can handle
  anything you throw at it.

  May your stacks be balanced and your words defined,
         -- The StarForth Development Team ⭐
```

### 🎮 More Easter Eggs to Find:

1. Try defining a word called `STARSHIP` and see what happens
2. Run `42 ENTROPY@ .` to see the universe's favorite number
3. Type `WORDS` and count how many contain 'STAR'
4. Check what happens when you `FORGET FORGET` (just kidding, don't!)
