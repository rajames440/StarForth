= StarForth Governance Documentation

== Overview

All governance documentation, policies, procedures, and formal specifications for the StarForth project are maintained in the **read-only governance vault** to ensure authoritative version control and traceability.

== Governance Vault Location

* **Archival**: Documents flow through in_basket → Reference workflow

== Governance Architecture

The StarForth project maintains **clear separation of concerns**:

[cols="1,1"]

| **StarForth Repo** | **StarForth-Governance Vault**
| Development code | Policy documents
| GitHub Issues | Procedures
| GitHub Projects | Formal specifications
| Work tracking | Version history
| CAPA tracking | Audit trail
| Build/CI systems | Reference archive
