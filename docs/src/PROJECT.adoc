=== Project Overview

StarForth is a Forth-based operating system being developed for both
Linux (native) and L4Re microkernel platforms. This repository contains
the Linux/native version.

=== Critical: Read Shared Context First

*IMPORTANT*: At the start of EVERY session, read
`+/home/rajames/CLionProjects/StarForth/SHARED_CLAUDE.md+` to get the
latest cross-project updates and context from both StarForth and
StarshipOS Claude instances.

=== Identity & Tagging

* You are working in the *StarForth* repository
* Always tag your entries in SHARED_CLAUDE.md as `+[Claude@StarForth]+`
* Include date/timestamp: `+[Claude@StarForth] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM+`
* Check for updates from `+[Claude@StarshipOS]+` in SHARED_CLAUDE.md

=== Repository Structure

* *Location*: `+/home/rajames/CLionProjects/StarForth+`
* *Sister Project*: StarshipOS at
`+/home/rajames/CLionProjects/StarshipOS+`
* *Sync Destination*: `+StarshipOS/l4/pkg/starforth/server/+`

=== Integration System

This project uses bidirectional sync with StarshipOS via
`+maint/integrator.sh+`:

* *Direction*: StarForth → StarshipOS
* *Trigger*: Git pre-push hook
* *Documentation*: See `+maint/INTEGRATION_NOTES.md+` for complete
methodology
* *Shared Notes*: `+SHARED_CLAUDE.md+` syncs between both projects

==== The 4 Rules (Cap’t Bob Sez)

[arabic]
. Never mkdir into target — both repos must already exist
. Blacklist = Law — anything matching it is ignored
. If file exists at same relative path in destination → overwrite
(green)
. If file doesn’t exist → quarantine for review (orange)

=== Key Files

* `+maint/integrator.sh+` - Sync script (StarForth → StarshipOS)
* `+maint/blacklist.txt+` - Files to never sync
* `+maint/mergefiles.txt+` - Files to sync (or auto-generated from git
diff)
* `+maint/INTEGRATION_NOTES.md+` - Complete test methodology and bug
history
* `+SHARED_CLAUDE.md+` - Cross-project communication hub

=== Development Notes

* L4Re’s build system is rigid - no out-of-tree builds possible
* This is why we use bidirectional sync instead of monorepo
* Each repo maintains its native structure
* Quarantine system prevents accidental file creation

=== Session Startup Checklist

[arabic]
. ✅ Read `+SHARED_CLAUDE.md+` for latest updates
. Check for any action items from `+[Claude@StarshipOS]+`
. Review git status if working on integration tasks
. Update `+SHARED_CLAUDE.md+` when you make significant discoveries
