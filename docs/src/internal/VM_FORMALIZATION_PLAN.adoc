= VM Formalization Roadmap
:toc: left
:toclevels: 2

This stub captures the staged approach for proving StarForth’s virtual machine.
It grows alongside the `.thy` files in `docs/src/internal/formal/`.

== Objectives

* Preserve room for architectural refactors while formal proofs evolve.
* Treat the physics metadata proofs (`Physics_StateMachine`,
`Physics_Observation`) as the first pillar and snap additional modules onto the same Isabelle session.
* Keep proof obligations discoverable from C headers and document invariants close to the runtime code.

== Session Layout

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
|Theory |Purpose (current status)
|`Physics_StateMachine` |Ring buffer + mailbox invariants for HOLA (active).
|`Physics_Observation` |Per-word physics updates, frame composition (active).
|`VM_Core` |Stub locale capturing the VM state shape, stack predicates (scaffolding).
|`VM_Stacks` |List-backed stack model locale and basic depth lemmas (scaffolding).
|`VM_Words` |Abstract wrappers for `>R` / `R>` stack transfers tied to locale lemmas.
|`VM_Register` |Dictionary model for `register_word` and the `>R`/`R>` registration helper.
|`VM_Dictionary` |_Planned:_ dictionary lifecycle, physics metadata wiring.
|`VM_Interpreter` |_Planned:_ interpreter state machine, execution semantics.
|`VM_IO` |_Planned:_ host capability shims, scheduler integration obligations.
|===

Each planned theory will import the prior layers, ensuring the session remains incrementally checkable (`isabelle build -D docs/src/internal/formal`).

== Development Guidelines

1. **Pair source and proof** – when a C module gains new invariants, add or update the matching `.thy` and mention the link in file-level comments.
2. **Prefer locales** – define subsystem properties via locales; extend them in follow-up theories rather than rewriting existing ones.
3. **Document assumptions** – every lemma should state the runtime assumptions it relies on (e.g., stack depth bounds, profiler hooks).
4. **Keep proofs fast** – favour algebraic lemmas over brute-force tactics so developers can replay the session during normal builds.
5. **Track TODOs** – leave `text` blocks or FIXME notes in the theory files indicating which runtime invariants still need encoding.

== Next Actions

. Flesh out `VM_Core` with stack depth and dictionary registry invariants once the corresponding C helpers stabilise.
. Introduce a `VM_Stacks.thy` that captures data/return stack well- formedness and pointer safety (aligned with `STRICT_PTR`).
. Model dictionary entries by referencing `DictEntry` and connect the physics metadata lemmas to the compiler pipeline.
. Decide on the C-to-Isabelle modelling path (AutoCorres vs. manual abstraction) before tackling the interpreter loop.
. Wire the future Makefile target to `isabelle build -D
docs/src/internal/formal` so CI can gate on proofs as they expand.

== VM Proof Checklist (Multi-day)

. **Session Baseline**
.. Record the theory order in `docs/src/internal/formal/ROOT` and keep the hierarchy (`VM_Core` → `VM_Stacks` → `VM_Words` → word modules).
.. Run the full session once to snapshot current failures; stash the output alongside this document for reference.
. **VM Core Invariants**
.. Expand `VM_Core` with pointer/limit invariants, error-flag rules, and separate assumptions for IO-facing capabilities.
.. Ensure every invariant is phrased as a lemma inside the `vm_core`
locale so later theories can reuse it.
. **Stack Model Helpers**
.. Add peek/push/pop transfer lemmas in `VM_Stacks` for each stack direction (data↔return, control, IO).
.. Prove both success and guard-failure variants plus runtime versions that expose `dsp`/`rsp` relationships.
. **Word Semantic Wrappers**
.. Split per-module theories (e.g., `Arithmetic_Words.thy`) that import
`VM_Words` and define `word_*` functions.
.. Derive success/no-op lemmas by reusing the helper facts; keep proofs to one or two lines via `simp` where possible.
. **Dictionary Registration**
.. Centralise registration lemmas in `VM_Register` (or a future
`VM_Dictionary`) so lookups prove which semantics back each entry.
.. Guard against reserved names and note unresolved conflicts inline.
. **Module March Template**
.. For each of the ~19 word modules: identify the C helper, confirm a matching Isabelle helper exists, create the wrapper lemma, register the word, and rerun the session before moving on.
.. Track status in a simple table (module, helper, lemmas, dictionary) to keep day-to-day progress visible.
. **IO / External Hooks**
.. Stub locale assumptions for side-effecting words; document what still needs modelling so later work can refine the assumptions.
. **Housekeeping**
.. Rebuild the Isabelle session nightly; treat a green build as the gate for committing.
.. Keep TODOs/FIXMEs close to the impacted lemma and reference this checklist when deferring work.
. **Stretch Goal**
.. Once every startup word is proven, aim for a consolidated theorem:
“All registered words satisfy their claimed semantics,” combining the lookup lemmas with the per-word proofs.

This document will expand as new proofs land; treat it as the architecture map for VM-level verification.
