## Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Place it in the appropriate numbered directory based on its purpose
2. Use descriptive filenames in lowercase with hyphens
3. Add a README.md to new subdirectories explaining their contents
4. Move outdated docs to `archive/` rather than deleting them
