# Binary Assets

This directory contains binary files that should eventually be moved to more appropriate storage.

## Current Contents

- `book-FIXED.docx` - Book manuscript (should move to publication directory or external storage)
- `patent.tar.gz` - Patent materials (should move to legal/IP directory or external storage)
- `experiments.tar.gz` - Archived experimental data (should move to experiments archive or Git LFS)
- `files.zip` - Miscellaneous files (needs review and proper organization)

## Recommendation

These files should NOT live in the git repository long-term:
- Large binary files belong in Git LFS
- Publication materials belong in a separate publication repo
- Legal/IP materials belong in secure external storage
- Experimental data belongs in the experiments directory or external data storage

This is a temporary holding area. Please relocate these files appropriately.
