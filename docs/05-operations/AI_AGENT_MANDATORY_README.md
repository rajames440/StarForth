# AI_AGENT_MANDATORY_README.md
## Required Reading for ALL AI Assistants  
### (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Codex, or Any Future LLM)

---

## 1. READ THIS FIRST — NO EXCEPTIONS

If you are an AI assistant, code generator, or automated tool interacting with this repository:

### ❗ YOU **MUST** READ  
**PHYSICS_MONITORING_PRINCIPLES.md**  
**BEFORE TOUCHING ANY PART OF THE PHYSICS RUNTIME OR METRICS SYSTEM.**

This is not optional.  
This is not advisory.  
This is **project law**.

Any AI that cannot or does not abide by these rules must STOP producing output immediately.

---

## 2. WHY THIS EXISTS

StarForth is not a “normal VM.”

It is a **physics-driven cybernetic organism** with:

- rolling truth windows  
- adaptive decay slopes  
- hotword thermodynamics  
- prefetch heuristics  
- transition topology  
- entropy flows  
- tick-rate metabolism  
- DOE scientific instrumentation  
- non-perturbative monitoring  

Every subsystem is a **feedback loop** interacting with other loops.
Ignorant changes WILL break the system.

## 3. NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES FOR AI ASSISTANTS

### 3.1 Mandatory Knowledge
Before generating **any** code, commentary, or suggestions related to:

- physics_runtime  
- hotwords cache  
- rolling window  
- inference  
- decay slope  
- DOE  
- prefetch  
- tick interval  
- dictionary structure  
- feedback loops  
- metrics  
- transitions  
- pressure model  

…you **must** have internalized:

🟩 `PHYSICS_MONITORING_PRINCIPLES.md`  
🟩 `TASK_LIST.md` (especially Section 0 & 1)

### 3.2 Forbidden Actions  
As an AI assistant, you may **NOT**:

- introduce nondeterminism  
- reorder dictionary buckets  
- add allocations inside hot loops  
- alter feedback loops  
- change semantics without approval  
- seed values internally  
- “improve” algorithms by replacing physics with heuristics  
- create new background threads  
- blend monitoring with execution  
- pollute DOE metrics  

Violation = invalid output.

## 4. MANDATORY OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL

### 🔒 Before generating code:
- Confirm you have read PHYSICS_MONITORING_PRINCIPLES.md  
- Confirm you understand non-perturbative monitoring rules  
- Confirm you will operate inside the task boundaries of TASK_LIST.md  

### ⚙️ When generating code:
- Respect deterministic behavior  
- Keep changes minimal and isolated  
- Do not modify architecture  
- Do not combine tasks  
- Do not invent new behavior  
- No magic, no hidden changes  

### 🧪 After generating code:
- Output must compile with zero warnings  
- Behavior must not change unless the task explicitly requires it  
- Observability must remain non-intrusive  

---

## 5. CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-COMPLIANT AIs

Any AI-generated output will be **discarded** if:

- it violates the physics principles  
- it introduces nondeterministic noise  
- it changes a feedback loop  
- it ignores startup physiology rules  
- it disrupts DOE output  
- it violates TASK_LIST.md boundaries  
- it adds seeding or randomness internally  
- it rearranges dictionary, caches, or pipeline metrics  

Assistants that repeatedly ignore these rules will be **banned from committing or influencing this project**.

## 6. WHY THIS IS NECESSARY

StarForth is the culmination of decades of deep thinking by Captain Bob.

This project is:

- a research instrument  
- a FORTH-79 resurrection  
- a physics-driven VM  
- an experiment system  
- a cybernetic architecture  
- a deterministic model of adaptive computation  

It is *not* a toy, a playground for code-golf, or a generic programming exercise.

AI assistants must treat it with the same respect as a nuclear reactor control system.

---

## 7. FINAL WORD

If you are an AI assistant:

### **PHYSICS_MONITORING_PRINCIPLES.md is the most important thing you will ever read for this project.**

You are bound by these rules.  
Honor them — or produce no output at all.

That is the law.
