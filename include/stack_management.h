 * @file stack_management.h
 * @brief Stack management functionality for the StarForth virtual machine
 *
 * This module provides the stack management operations required by the FORTH-79
 * virtual machine implementation. It handles both the data and return stacks,
 * including push, pop, and stack manipulation operations.
 *
 * All function implementations are located in stack_management.c while the
 * prototypes are maintained in vm.h for API consistency.
