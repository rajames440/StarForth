= StarForth Capability-Based Kernel Validation Framework

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Governance Framework
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

---

== Vision: From VM to Microkernel

StarForth evolves through three architectural phases:

[cols="2,2,2,2"]
|===
| Phase | Foundation | Architecture | StarForth Role

| **Phase 1 (NOW)**
| L4Re/Fiasco.OC
| Microkernel + L4Re + StarForth VM
| FORTH-79 interpreter (application layer)

| **Phase 2 (COMING)**
| seL4 (formally verified)
| Formally-verified microkernel + StarForth VM
| FORTH-79 interpreter (application layer)

| **Phase 3 (FUTURE)**
| StarForth
| StarForth becomes the microkernel
| Capability-based kernel with Isabelle/HOL proofs

|===

This governance framework validates StarForth across ALL three phases by:

1. **Layers 1-2 (NOW):** Validate StarForth as a capability-ready VM
2. **Layer 3 (FUTURE):** Define architecture for kernel-level formal proofs

---

== The Capability-Based Architecture

StarForth's distinguishing innovation: **Every FORTH word is a capability-guarded function**.

=== Design Principles

**Access Control at Function Level (not page level):**
- Traditional kernels: Memory isolation via MMU/pages
- StarForth kernel: Access control via ACL-guarded word definitions
- Each word call validates: `caller has capability to execute(word)`

**Dictionary-Based Isolation:**
- Each StarForth VM has its own specialized dictionary
- Root VM governs physical resources + scheduler + pub/sub
- Child VMs see logical abstractions (logical block addresses, message queues)
- Cross-VM function calls: Routed through capabilities, not direct access

**Deterministic Execution:**
- Physics-informed scheduling (not priority-based)
- Pub/sub message broker (ordered, reliable delivery)
- Essential for formal verification (Isabelle/HOL)

=== System Architecture

== Three-Layer Validation Framework

The validation framework scales from component (VM) to system (kernel) assurance:

=== Layer 1: Foundation (Software Engineering Rigor)

**What it validates:**
- FORTH-79 semantic correctness (what the VM does)
- Deterministic behavior (required for formal proofs)
- Requirements traceability (what the code does vs. specification)
- Test coverage (all code paths tested)
- Code organization (no hidden dependencies)

**Standards covered:**
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 (Software Lifecycle)
- ISO/IEC 25010 (Quality Model)
- IEEE 730 (QA Plan)
- IEEE 1012 (V&V Plan)
- ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 (Testing)

**Key documents:**
- `FORTH-79_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc` - Semantic correctness
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) - Spec → Code mapping
- Test Plan and Results - Test coverage metrics
- Architecture Documentation - Design decisions

**Realistic for v1.0:** YES
- 675+ existing test suite covers FORTH-79 core
- Code is already modular (19 word modules)
- Just needs documentation and traceability

**Validation Question:** Does StarForth implement FORTH-79 correctly and completely?

---

=== Layer 2: Reliability & Quality (Defensive Design)

**What it validates:**
- Code quality (measurable defect susceptibility)
- Secure coding (no injection, buffer overflow, uninitialized access)
- Memory safety (fixed arena, no malloc/free)
- Fault isolation (failures don't cascade)
- Capability readiness (code is structured for ACL guards)

**Standards covered:**
- ISO/IEC 5055 (Source Code Quality)
- MISRA C:2023 (Safer C subset)
- SEI CERT C (Secure Coding)
- NIST SSDF (Secure Software Development)
- NIST CSF 2.0 (Governance Framework)

**Key documents:**
- Static Code Analysis Report (SonarQube, Clang analyzer baseline)
- MISRA C:2023 Compliance Report
- CERT C Guidelines Checklist
- Security Architecture Review
- ACL Pattern Documentation (how words will be guarded in kernel)

**Realistic for v1.0:** YES
- Code is already defensive (no malloc, fixed memory, bounds checking)
- Just needs automated analysis and documentation

**Validation Question:** Is StarForth robust, secure, and architecturally ready for capability-based access control?

---

=== Layer 3: Advanced Assurance (Formal Verification & Kernel Guarantees)

**What it validates (future):**
- ACL enforcement correctness (theorem proofs in Isabelle/HOL)
- Word composition safety (arbitrary word sequences are safe)
- Scheduler correctness (physics-informed algorithm is sound)
- Isolation guarantees (dictionary separation prevents leaks)
- Pub/Sub reliability (message ordering, delivery guarantees)

**Standards/Approaches:**
- Isabelle/HOL (theorem proving)
- seL4 formal verification methodology
- Coq/Isabelle for kernel proofs
- CompCert verified compiler (C → binary trust)

**Key documents (STUBS - future work):**
- `ACL_ENFORCEMENT_THEOREMS.adoc` - Word access control proofs
- `WORD_COMPOSITION_SAFETY.adoc` - Arbitrary word sequence safety
- `SCHEDULER_CORRECTNESS.adoc` - Physics algorithm soundness
- `ISOLATION_GUARANTEES.adoc` - Dictionary isolation proofs
- `PUBSUB_RELIABILITY_SPEC.adoc` - Message broker specification

**Realistic for v1.0:** NO
- Requires formal verification infrastructure setup
- Requires Isabelle/HOL theorem proofs (research effort)
- Depends on Phase 3 implementation (StarForth as kernel)

**Timeline:** v2.0 (seL4 port) + v3.0+ (full kernel validation)

**Validation Question:** Can we mathematically PROVE that no word can violate ACLs? That arbitrary word sequences are safe?

== What "Compliance" Means at Each Layer

=== Layer 1 Compliance

**Claim:** "StarForth is FORTH-79 standard compliant"

**What this means:** Every word in FORTH-79 spec is correctly implemented with proven test coverage.

**What this does NOT mean:** StarForth is "certified" by anyone. No external certification needed.

**Evidence:** 675+ test suite + standard mapping document

---

=== Layer 2 Compliance

**Claim:** "StarForth follows professional secure coding and quality standards"

**What this means:** Code quality is measurable, passes static analysis, follows MISRA/CERT, has no known security issues.

**What this does NOT mean:** StarForth is "secure" against all attacks. Security is contextual to how it's deployed.

**Evidence:** SonarQube report + MISRA/CERT checklist + security architecture review

---

=== Layer 3 Compliance (Future)

**Claim:** "StarForth kernel is formally verified correct in Isabelle/HOL"

**What this means:** Mathematical proofs demonstrate ACL enforcement, isolation, scheduler soundness, etc.

**What this does NOT mean:** Hardware is correct, compiler is correct, or assumptions are perfect. Just the kernel software logic.

**Evidence:** Isabelle/HOL theorem repository + machine-checked proofs
