### Verification Path for Unverified Claims:

**Anyone can now verify MISRA C/CERT C claims by:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rajames440/StarForth
cd StarForth

# Run MISRA C checker
cppcheck --addon=misra.json src/

# Run CERT C checker
flawfinder src/

# Run static analysis
scan-build make

# Verify test count
grep -r "TEST(" tests/ | wc -l

# Measure code coverage
make clean && COVERAGE=1 make test
lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
```

**This is the beauty of open source + good governance.**
