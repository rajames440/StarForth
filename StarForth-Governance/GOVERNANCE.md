# StarForth Governance

**Document ID:** starforth-governance/governance
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active

---

## Repository Purpose

This repository establishes the governance and validation framework for **StarForth** - the FORTH-79 standard-compliant virtual machine at the core of StarshipOS.

## Maintenance

**Maintainer:** Robert A. James (rajames440)
**License:** CC0 v1.0 (public domain)
**Update Cadence:** Per phase transitions and major compliance updates

## How Compliance is Validated

### Continuous Validation
- 675+ test suite runs on every commit
- Tests pass 100% before release
- Test suite covers 100% of FORTH-79 core words
- All platforms validated (Linux x86_64, ARM64, embedded)

### Release Criteria
All of the following must be true:

1. ✓ All 675+ tests pass on all supported platforms
2. ✓ FORTH-79_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc shows 100% coverage
3. ✓ ANSI_C99_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc shows strict compilation
4. ✓ No compiler warnings or errors
5. ✓ Documentation is complete and current

### Escalation Path for Non-Compliance

**Critical Issue** (test failures, security):
- Immediate escalation to maintainer
- Fix must be verified before release
- Root cause analysis required
- Test added to prevent regression

**Major Issue** (missing feature, performance regression):
- Review within 1 week
- Design decision documented
- Fix or documentation update required

**Minor Issue** (documentation, build optimization):
- Review within 2 weeks
- Non-critical path to resolution

## Integration with StarshipOS

### StarForth Lifecycle

StarForth is used in **three phases** of StarshipOS:

**Phase 1 (NOW):** StarForth on L4Re/Fiasco.OC
- StarForth maintains FORTH-79 compliance
- L4Re provides microkernel foundation
- This governance repo proves StarForth correctness

**Phase 2 (COMING):** StarForth on seL4
- StarForth maintains FORTH-79 compliance
- seL4 adds formal verification
- StarshipOS governance repo handles integration
- ALM discipline begins (physics innovations)

**Phase 3 (FUTURE):** StarForth as kernel
- StarForth becomes both application and kernel
- No external hypervisor dependency
- Complete validation chain possible
- StarForth governance + extended kernel specs

### Cross-Reference Documentation

- **StarshipOS Governance:** https://github.com/rajames440/StarshipOS-Governance
  - Phase roadmap (Phase 1/2/3 strategy)
  - Hypervisor layering architecture
  - ALM discipline (Phase 2+ physics innovations)

- **StarForth Repository:** https://github.com/rajames440/StarForth
  - Actual source code (19 modules)
  - 675+ test suite
  - Build artifacts

## LTS Commitment

### Long-Term Support

StarForth maintains **LTS (Long-Term Support)** across all phases:

**Security Updates:** Yes, 5+ years
**Bug Fixes:** Yes, critical/major
**Documentation:** Current and maintained
**Community Support:** Active GitHub discussions

### Compatibility Guarantee

Once released, FORTH-79 compliance is **guaranteed**:
- Core word behavior cannot change
- New features must be additive (not breaking)
- Extensions documented separately from core
- Backward compatibility preserved

## Standards References

- **FORTH-79 Standard** - Official specification
- **ANSI C99** - Implementation language
- **L4Re Architecture** - Phase 1 hypervisor
- **seL4 Formal Verification** - Phase 2 hypervisor

## Communication

**Issue Reporting:** GitHub Issues (preferred)
**Discussions:** GitHub Discussions
