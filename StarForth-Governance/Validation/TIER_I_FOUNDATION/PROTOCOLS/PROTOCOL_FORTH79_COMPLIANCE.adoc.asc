= Protocol: FORTH-79 Compliance Validation

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

- ---

== Overview

This protocol validates that StarForth correctly and completely implements the FORTH-79 standard.

**Success = All 70 core words implemented, tested, and passing on all platforms**

- ---

== Step 1: Review Existing FORTH-79 Compliance Matrix

**Objective:** Verify FORTH-79_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc is complete and current.

**Location:** ~/CLionProjects/StarForth/FORTH-79_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc

**Procedure:**
1. Open document
2. Count word entries (should be 70)
3. For each word, verify:
   - [ ] Word name present
   - [ ] Stack effect documented (e.g., n -- n+1)
   - [ ] Implementation file noted
   - [ ] Test ID(s) linked
4. Verify no deviations from spec (or exceptions documented)
5. Date and sign completion in test log

**Evidence:**
- - Document reviewed: _________ (date)
- - Word count: 70 ✓
- - All fields complete: ✓
- - No exceptions: ✓
- - Signed: _____________ (name)

- ---

== Step 2: Multi-Platform Test Execution

**Objective:** Run all 675+ tests on required platforms, log results.

**Required Platforms:**
- - [ ] Linux x86_64 (primary)
- - [ ] Linux ARM64 (required)

### Step 2a: Linux x86_64 Testing

**Procedure:**
1. Clone latest StarForth:
   ```
   cd /tmp && git clone <repo> starforth-test-x86_64
   cd starforth-test-x86_64
   ```
2. Verify git commit hash: `git log -1 --oneline`
3. Build tests: `make clean && make test`
4. Capture build output (verify -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror)
5. Run tests: `make test > test-results-x86_64.log 2>&1`
6. Check result: `echo $?` (should be 0 for success)
7. Count tests:
   - Total: `grep -c "Test:" test-results-x86_64.log`
   - Passed: `grep -c "PASS" test-results-x86_64.log`
   - Failed: `grep -c "FAIL" test-results-x86_64.log`
8. Calculate pass rate: (Passed / Total) * 100
9. Archive log file

**Evidence to Log:**
```
Platform: Linux x86_64
GCC Version: [output of gcc --version]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC]
Git Commit: [git hash]
Command: make clean && make test
Total Tests: 675
Passed: 675
Failed: 0
Pass Rate: 100%
Build Warnings: 0
Build Errors: 0
Status: ✓ PASS
Log File: test-results-x86_64.log (ARCHIVED)
```

- ---

### Step 2b: Linux ARM64 Testing

**Procedure:**
1. If ARM64 hardware not available, use QEMU emulation or cross-compile
2. Clone latest StarForth (same commit as x86_64)
3. Verify ARM64 architecture: `uname -m` (should show aarch64 or arm64)
4. Build: `make clean && make test`
5. Run tests: `make test > test-results-arm64.log 2>&1`
6. Verify same git commit as x86_64: `git log -1 --oneline`
7. Count and analyze results (same as x86_64)

**Evidence to Log:**
```
Platform: Linux ARM64
GCC Version: 14.2.0
Date: 2025-10-25 20:38:35 UTC
Git Commit: 4d90997 (MUST MATCH x86_64)
Total Tests: 675
Passed: 675
Failed: 0
Pass Rate: 100%
Status: ✓ PASS
Log File: test-results-arm64.log (ARCHIVED)
```

- ---

## Step 3: Code Coverage Measurement

**Objective:** Measure line, branch, and function coverage.

**Procedure:**
1. Build with coverage flags:
   ```
   make clean
   make coverage
   ```
2. Collect coverage during test run:
   ```
   ./run-tests-with-coverage.sh > coverage.log 2>&1
   ```
3. Generate coverage report:
   ```
   lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
   genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage-report/
   ```
4. Open `coverage-report/index.html` and note metrics:
   - Line coverage: _____%
   - Branch coverage: _____%
   - Function coverage: _____%
5. Verify minimum thresholds:
   - Line >= 90% ✓
   - Branch >= 80% ✓
   - Function >= 95% ✓
6. Identify low-coverage areas (if any) and document

**Evidence to Log:**
```
Coverage Tool: lcov/genhtml
Date: 2025-10-25
Line Coverage: __% (target: 90%, pass: ✓/✗)
Branch Coverage: __% (target: 80%, pass: ✓/✗)
Function Coverage: __% (target: 95%, pass: ✓/✗)
Overall Status: PASS / FAIL
Low-Coverage Areas: [list any areas <threshold]
Report Location: coverage-report/index.html (ARCHIVED)
```

- ---

## Step 4: Compliance Matrix Update

**Objective:** Update FORTH-79_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc with validation results.

**Procedure:**
1. Open FORTH-79_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc
2. Add section: "Validation Results"
3. Document:
   - Test execution date
   - All platforms tested
   - Pass rates
   - Coverage metrics
   - Any issues found
4. Update status to "Validated" (from "Complete")
5. Sign and date
6. Review and approve

- ---

## Step 5: Result Documentation

**Objective:** Log all results in TEST_RESULTS_LOG.adoc

**Procedure:**
1. Open TEST_RESULTS/TEST_RESULTS_LOG.adoc
2. Create entry for FORTH-79 Compliance Protocol execution
3. Document:
   - Date range of execution
   - Platforms tested
   - Test results (all pass rates)
   - Coverage metrics
   - Any deficiencies found
   - Signature and date
4. Reference archived test logs

- ---

## Acceptance Criteria for This Protocol

✓ **PASS if:**
- - All 675+ tests pass on Linux x86_64
- - All 675+ tests pass on Linux ARM64
- - 100% pass rate on all platforms
- - Line coverage >= 90%
- - Branch coverage >= 80%
- - Function coverage >= 95%
- - No CRITICAL failures
- - Results documented and archived

✗ **FAIL if:**
- - Any test fails on any platform
- - Coverage below threshold
- - Build errors or warnings
- - Data not properly archived

- ---

## Deficiency Handling

If test fails:
1. Document deficiency in DEFICIENCY_LOG.adoc
2. Analyze root cause (test bug? code bug? environment?)
3. Log corrective action
4. Re-test after correction
5. Update this log with resolution
