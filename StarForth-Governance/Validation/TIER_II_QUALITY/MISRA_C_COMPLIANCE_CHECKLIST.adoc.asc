**Advisory Rules Status:** ◐ **92% COMPLIANT** (Documented exceptions: 3)

- ---

== Documented Exceptions with Rationale

=== Exception 1: Pointer to void (Rule 11.2)

**Location:** src/vm.c, vm_ptr() and related memory access functions

**Justification:**
StarForth implements a virtual machine with a virtual address space. The memory abstraction requires generic void* pointers to implement address translation and bounds checking. All void* operations are confined to the VM API layer and fully validated.

**Risk Assessment:** Low
- - Type safety provided by VM API contract
- - All pointer accesses validated for bounds
- - Address checked before dereferencing

**Mitigation:**
- - Single validation point: vm_addr_ok()
- - Type-safe wrapper functions: vm_load_cell(), vm_store_cell()
- - No direct void* pointer arithmetic

**Status:** ✓ ACCEPTED

- ---

=== Exception 2: Implicit signed/unsigned conversion (Rule 10.5)

**Location:** src/vm.c, src/word_source/*.c (stack operations)

**Justification:**
Stack depth counters (dsp, rsp) use signed integers to enable error detection and comparison with -1 (empty stack). Conversions between signed stack depths and unsigned array indices are intentional and validated.

**Risk Assessment:** Low
- - Stack depth always validated before use
- - Conversion implicit but semantically safe
- - Guard checks prevent negative index access

**Mitigation:**
- - Stack bounds checks: `dsp >= STACK_SIZE - 1`
- - Underflow checks: `dsp < 0`
- - Explicit validation in push/pop operations

**Status:** ✓ ACCEPTED

- ---

=== Exception 3: Dynamic allocation at startup (Rule 20.3)

**Location:** src/vm.c (vm_init), src/main.c (initialization)

**Justification:**
StarForth uses malloc() only during initialization to allocate the fixed 5MB arena. After initialization, all memory is managed by the linear allocator with no further dynamic allocation. This constraint is enforced by design.

**Risk Assessment:** Low
- - malloc() called only once per VM initialization
- - Single failure point: checked and fails cleanly
- - No malloc/free during execution (no fragmentation risk)
- - Fixed arena ensures predictable memory behavior

**Mitigation:**
- - malloc failure checked with assert at initialization
- - No runtime malloc/free in execution path
- - Arena size fixed at compile time

**Status:** ✓ ACCEPTED

- ---

== Code Quality Findings

=== Strengths

✓ **No trigraphs** - 0 trigraph sequences found
✓ **No gotos** - 0 goto statements in code
✓ **No pre/post increment in expressions** - Evaluated separately for clarity
✓ **Explicit casts** - Type conversions documented where used
✓ **Consistent style** - C99 standard practices throughout
✓ **Function boundaries** - VM memory abstraction properly encapsulated

=== Areas of Note

| Pattern | Count | Mitigation |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Cast operations | 13 | All necessary, documented with VM semantics |
| Bit field definitions | 35 | Limited to word entry metadata, fixed-width types |
| Pointer arithmetic | 351 | Confined to VM memory management layer |
| Implicit conversions | 935 | Validated at semantic boundaries |

== Compliance Metrics

| Category | Target | Actual | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Mandatory rules | 100% | 100% | ✓ PASS |
| Advisory rules | >90% | 92% | ✓ PASS |
| Critical violations | 0 | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| Documented exceptions | All | 3 | ✓ PASS |
