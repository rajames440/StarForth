## Critical Guidance

### DO These Things for v1.0

1. **Complete Layer 1 documentation** - Foundation for all claims
2. **Run static analysis tools** - ISO 5055, CERT C, CWE
3. **Document security practices** - NIST SSDF attestation
4. **Create compliance reports** - Evidence for customers
5. **Remediate identified issues** - Expected: minimal given defensive design

### DON'T Do These Things

1. **Don't pursue safety certification speculatively** - Requires system context
2. **Don't pursue Common Criteria without customer** - Too expensive ($100K-1M)
3. **Don't claim ISO 9001/27001** - Those are organizational certifications
4. **Don't attempt full formal verification for v1.0** - Research effort, not necessary
5. **Don't claim domain-specific compliance** - Unless actually targeting that domain

### CONDITIONAL Decisions

**MISRA C:2023**
- Pro: Industry-standard for safety-critical C
- Con: Requires commercial tool ($5K-30K)
- Decision: Include if budget allows OR customer requires

**ISO 27034 Security Documentation**
- Pro: Demonstrates security-conscious design
- Con: Medium effort (4-8 weeks)
- Decision: Include for v1.0 (supports Layer 4 partial)

**CompCert Compiler**
- Pro: Formally verified compilation
- Con: License cost ($5K-20K)
- Decision: v2.0 or later, not critical for v1.0

- Layer 2 analysis: $15K-50K (run tools, remediate, document)

**Timeline: 10-20 weeks (2.5-5 months)**

### v2.0 Investment (seL4 Platform)

**Budget: $50K-150K**
- seL4 port engineering
- Validation and testing
