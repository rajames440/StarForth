# Audit Recovery Log - 2025-10-31

## MISTAKE DESCRIPTION

**What Went Wrong:**
Claude Code created governance documents (GOVERNANCE_DECLARATION_2025-10-31.adoc,
COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT_2025-10-31.md) and committed them to the StarForth main repository instead of routing them to
the StarForth-Governance submodule's in_basket/ directory.

**Root Cause:**
Failed to examine the StarForth-Governance repository structure before proceeding with document creation. Did not
understand the proper workflow:

1. Create/generate documents
2. Stage in main repo
3. Move via `mv` to governance/in_basket/
4. Commit to governance repo only
5. Do NOT commit governance documents to main repo

**Severity:**
CRITICAL - Violates governance architecture principle that governance is maintained in separate read-only submodule.

---

## WHAT WAS COMMITTED TO MAIN REPO (INCORRECTLY)

**Commits to Revert:**

- `fe4503bd` - "Governance Artifact: Comprehensive Audit Report (2025-10-31)"
    - File: COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT_2025-10-31.md (452 lines)
    - Should be: In governance/in_basket/

- `e594457c` - "governance: Issue formal declaration - All procedures fully in force (2025-10-31)"
    - File: docs/GOVERNANCE_DECLARATION_2025-10-31.adoc (392 lines)
    - Should be: In governance/in_basket/

**GitHub Issues Created (INCORRECTLY):**

- Issues #56-64 (9 CAPA issues created from incorrect audit)
- Status: CANCELLED - Will be recreated after proper audit

---

## RECOVERY STEPS

1. **Revert incorrect commits:**
    - Reset to commit 9d356427 (last good state before governance modifications)
    - Preserve COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT_2025-10-31.md and GOVERNANCE_DECLARATION_2025-10-31.adoc in temporary location

2. **Examine StarForth-Governance structure:**
    - Understand proper in_basket/ workflow
    - Identify document routing procedures
    - Understand how governance documents should be captured and archived

3. **Create proper in_basket/ in governance repo:**
    - If doesn't exist, create in_basket/ directory in governance submodule
    - Establish proper document capture procedures

4. **Move documents to governance/in_basket/:**
    - Use filesystem `mv` to move audit documents
    - Stage in governance submodule
    - Commit to governance repo

5. **Redo comprehensive audit:**
    - Run audit again with proper document handling
    - Route all governance artifacts to governance/in_basket/
    - Create CAPA issues only after documents properly routed

6. **Document lesson learned:**
    - Add this recovery log to main repo as governance artifact
    - Reference improper workflow and correct procedures

---

## KEY LESSON

**Proper Workflow for Governance Documents:**

```
1. Create document in temporary location
2. git add (stage in main repo)
3. mv to governance/in_basket/
4. cd governance && git add
5. cd governance && git commit
6. cd .. && git add (update submodule pointer if needed)
7. git commit -m "Update governance submodule with new documents"
```

**What I Did Wrong:**

```
1. Created document in main repo
2. git commit to main repo ❌
3. Never moved to governance submodule ❌
4. Created CAPAs based on documents in wrong location ❌
```
