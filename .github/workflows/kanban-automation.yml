# KANBAN BOARD SETUP GUIDE

# For GitHub Projects V1 (Classic Projects):
#
# 1. Create a new GitHub Project
#    - Go to Projects tab in repository
#    - Click "New Project"
#    - Name: "StarForth Release Pipeline"
#    - Template: "Automated kanban with reviews"
#
# 2. Create columns (default from template):
#    - "To do" → rename to "Backlog"
#    - "In progress" → "In Progress"
#    - "Done" → "Released"
#    - Add custom column: "Qual Gate"
#    - Add custom column: "Testing"
#    - Add custom column: "Ready for Release"
#
# 3. Add issues to the project:
#    - GitHub → Issues → Create issue for each feature/task
#    - Add to project: Drag to "Backlog" column
#
# 4. Link PRs to issues:
#    - In PR description: "Closes #123" (links to issue)
#    - Workflow automatically moves card when PR merges
#
# CARD PROGRESSION:
#   Backlog
#    ↓ (PR created)
#   In Progress
#    ↓ (PR merged → devL pipeline)
#   Testing
#    ↓ (Test + Qual pipelines pass)
#   Qual Gate
#    ↓ (PM approves release)
#   Ready for Release
#    ↓ (Prod pipeline succeeds)
#   Released
#
# AUTOMATION RULES (manual setup in GitHub Projects):
#   - PR opened in column X → move to "In Progress"
#   - PR merged → move to "Testing"
#   - Auto-comment with status updates
#   - On release approval → move to "Ready for Release"
#   - On prod success → move to "Released"
#
# NOTE: GitHub Projects V2 (beta) provides better automation via API
#       To use V2, replace workflow with graphql mutations to move items
