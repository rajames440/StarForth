= Correction and Remediation Procedure

**Version:** 1.0.0

== Overview

When a deficiency is discovered during validation, this procedure defines how it is resolved.

== Steps

=== 1. Log Deficiency

- - Assign DEF-ID (DEF-YYYY-NNN)
- - Document in DEFICIENCY_LOG.adoc
- - Classify severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- - Describe issue clearly

=== 2. Root Cause Analysis

- - Why did this happen?
- - Is it a code issue? Test issue? Documentation issue?
- - Could it happen again?

=== 3. Plan Correction

- - What needs to be fixed?
- - Who will fix it?
- - By when?
- - What's the test plan to prove it's fixed?

=== 4. Execute Correction

- - Implement the fix
- - Commit to git with reference to DEF-ID
- - Document what was changed

=== 5. Test Correction

- - Execute test plan
- - Log test results
- - Verify fix works
- - Verify no new issues introduced

=== 6. Close Deficiency

- - Document evidence that fix works
- - Update DEFICIENCY_LOG status to CLOSED
- - Archive in closed deficiencies section
- - Update metrics

== Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Max Time to Close |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| CRITICAL | Blocks Tier acceptance | 1 week |
| HIGH | Impacts functionality | 2 weeks |
| MEDIUM | Minor issue | 4 weeks |
| LOW | Cosmetic/future | Next version |

== Waivers

If deficiency cannot be fixed, it may be WAIVED with documented exception:
- - Technical rationale (why this is acceptable)
- - Approval by Review Authority
- - Documented in deficiency log

== Escalation

If deficiency cannot be resolved:
1. Escalate to Maintainer
2. Assess impact on Tier acceptance
3. Decide: Fix, Waive, or Defer to next version
4. Document decision
