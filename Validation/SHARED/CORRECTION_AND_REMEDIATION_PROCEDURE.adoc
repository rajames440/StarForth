= Correction and Remediation Procedure

**Version:** 1.0.0

== Overview

When a deficiency is discovered during validation, this procedure defines how it is resolved.

== Steps

=== 1. Log Deficiency

- Assign DEF-ID (DEF-YYYY-NNN)
- Document in DEFICIENCY_LOG.adoc
- Classify severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Describe issue clearly

=== 2. Root Cause Analysis

- Why did this happen?
- Is it a code issue? Test issue? Documentation issue?
- Could it happen again?

=== 3. Plan Correction

- What needs to be fixed?
- Who will fix it?
- By when?
- What's the test plan to prove it's fixed?

=== 4. Execute Correction

- Implement the fix
- Commit to git with reference to DEF-ID
- Document what was changed

=== 5. Test Correction

- Execute test plan
- Log test results
- Verify fix works
- Verify no new issues introduced

=== 6. Close Deficiency

- Document evidence that fix works
- Update DEFICIENCY_LOG status to CLOSED
- Archive in closed deficiencies section
- Update metrics

== Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Max Time to Close |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| CRITICAL | Blocks Tier acceptance | 1 week |
| HIGH | Impacts functionality | 2 weeks |
| MEDIUM | Minor issue | 4 weeks |
| LOW | Cosmetic/future | Next version |

== Waivers

If deficiency cannot be fixed, it may be WAIVED with documented exception:
- Technical rationale (why this is acceptable)
- Approval by Review Authority
- Documented in deficiency log

== Escalation

If deficiency cannot be resolved:
1. Escalate to Maintainer
2. Assess impact on Tier acceptance
3. Decide: Fix, Waive, or Defer to next version
4. Document decision
