## Standards NOT Used (and Why)

=== ISO 9001: Quality Management System

**Why not:**
- Applies to organizations, not software
- StarForth is a project, not an organization
- Would require certifying body audit

---

=== ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management

**Why not:**
- System-level, not component-level
- Applies to security operations, not software
- StarForth is a component, not a complete system

---

=== Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408)

**Why not (now):**
- Expensive evaluation ($100K+)
- Requires certification body
- Only pursued if customer requires
- Phase 3+ consideration only

---

=== Safety Standards (IEC 61508, ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 62304)

**Why not (now):**
- System-level (require system context)
- Cannot claim SIL/ASIL without knowing deployment
- Phase 3+ consideration if used in safety-critical system
- Can claim "architecture consistent with" safety practices

---

=== GDPR / Data Protection

**Why not:**
- Applies to personal data handling
- StarForth doesn't handle personal data by design
- Not relevant to interpreter/kernel
