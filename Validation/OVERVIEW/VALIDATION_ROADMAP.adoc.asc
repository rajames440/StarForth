- - 1 Maintainer (part-time, 20%) — seL4 port oversight
- - 1 seL4 Expert (part-time, TBD) — Integration guidance

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 weeks FTE

- ---

== Risk Assessment

=== High Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Deficiency discovered late in Tier II | Blocks v1.0 release | Weekly metrics reviews |
| seL4 port takes longer than expected | Delays v2.0 | Start now, run parallel |
| Proof attempts fail (unforeseen) | Tier III blocked | Prototype formalization early |

=== Medium Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Expertise gap in formal verification | Tier III slow | Hire/consult expert early |
| Documentation incomplete for hand-off | Quality drops | Mandatory doc checklist |
| Test coverage gaps discovered | Acceptance fails | Weekly coverage metrics |

### Low Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Minor deficiencies in Tier I-II | Isolated fixes | Deficiency log + remediation |
| Performance regressions | Not release-blocking | Performance baseline, alerts |

- ---

== Dependencies and Constraints

=== Hard Dependencies

- - [ ] Git repository available
- - [ ] StarForth source code stable (not under major refactoring)
- - [ ] Platform support stable (Linux, Fiasco.OC, seL4)

=== Soft Dependencies

- - [ ] Team commitment (validation is not part-time)
- - [ ] Management support (not canceling validation halfway)
- - [ ] Customer interest (validation is not hypothetical)
