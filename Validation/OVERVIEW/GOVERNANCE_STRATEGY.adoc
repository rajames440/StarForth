= StarForth Governance Strategy

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

---

== Executive Summary

StarForth is evolving from a FORTH-79 virtual machine to a capability-based microkernel. This governance strategy defines how we will validate each phase of that evolution.

**Key principle:** We validate what matters at each stage.

- **Now (Phase 1-2):** Validate StarForth as a correct, robust, VM
- **Soon (Phase 2):** Validate StarForth on seL4 (formally verified platform)
- **Future (Phase 3):** Validate StarForth as a formally-proven microkernel

---

== The Problem We're Solving

Traditional operating systems (Linux, Windows) have:
- **25+ million lines of code** in the kernel
- **Impossible to validate completely**
- **Security vulnerabilities discovered continuously**

StarForth's approach:
- **Microkernel architecture** — Minimal trusted computing base (TCB)
- **Capability-based security** — Fine-grained access control at function level
- **Formal verification roadmap** — Eventually mathematically proven

**But we cannot claim these benefits without validation.**

This governance strategy ensures we can defend every claim we make about StarForth.

---

== What We Are Doing

=== Three-Tier Validation Model

**Tier I: Foundation**
- FORTH-79 semantic correctness (does it do what it says?)
- Complete requirements traceability
- Comprehensive testing (675+ tests)
- Architecture documentation

**Tier II: Reliability & Quality**
- Code quality measurement (SonarQube, static analysis)
- Secure coding standards (MISRA C, CERT C)
- Memory safety proof (fixed arena, bounds checking)
- Deterministic execution guarantee
- Capability-ready design

**Tier III: Formal Assurance** (Future)
- ACL enforcement correctness proofs (Isabelle/HOL)
- Word composition safety proofs
- Scheduler correctness proofs
- Isolation guarantee proofs
- Message broker reliability proofs

=== Three-Phase Evolution

**Phase 1 (NOW):** L4Re/Fiasco.OC + StarForth VM
- Validation: Tiers I-II complete
- Platform: External microkernel provides isolation
- Purpose: Prove StarForth component correctness

**Phase 2 (COMING):** seL4 + StarForth VM
- Validation: Tiers I-II complete, inherit seL4 formal verification
- Platform: Formally-verified microkernel
- Purpose: Add formally-verified foundation

**Phase 3 (FUTURE):** StarForth as Microkernel
- Validation: Tiers I-III complete (include our own formal proofs)
- Platform: StarForth kernel directly
- Purpose: Fully formally-verified OS

---

== What We WILL Do

=== For v1.0 (Next 3-6 months)

**Tier I Completion:**
- Complete FORTH-79 compliance documentation
- Create requirements traceability matrix
- Document architecture and design
- Finalize test methodology

**Tier II Completion:**
- Establish code quality baseline (SonarQube)
- Document secure coding compliance (MISRA/CERT)
- Validate memory safety
- Prove deterministic execution
- Identify ACL integration points

**Documentation:**
- All governance documents complete
- Validation protocols written
- All test results logged
- Final reports signed off

**Result:** Can claim "Layer 1-2 validated" for any deployment

---

=== For v2.0 (Phase 2, seL4 port)

**Tier I-II Extended:**
- Validate StarForth + seL4 integration
- Verify all tests pass on seL4
- Document capability model integration

**Formal Foundation:**
- Leverage seL4 formal proofs
- Document what's proven by seL4
- Document what's our responsibility

**Result:** Can claim "Runs on formally-verified microkernel"

---

=== For v3.0+ (Phase 3, Kernel)

**Tier III Completion:**
- Formalize ACL model in Isabelle/HOL
- Prove ACL enforcement correctness
- Prove word composition safety
- Prove scheduler correctness
- Prove isolation guarantees
- Prove message broker reliability

**Result:** Can claim "Formally verified microkernel"

---

== Why This Approach

=== Why Tiers, Not All-at-Once?

**Because validation is not binary.**

- Tier I proves we have a correct VM (good enough for many uses)
- Tier II proves the VM is robust and secure (good for embedded)
- Tier III proves the kernel is mathematically correct (good for safety-critical)

Different customers have different needs:
- Embedded systems need Tier I-II
- Medical devices might need Tier II + targeted Tier III proofs
- Aerospace/avionics might need Tier III complete

**We don't want to wait 2 years for Tier III if customers need Tier I-II now.**

=== Why Phases Matter

**Phase 1 (L4Re/Fiasco.OC):**
- External microkernel handles isolation and scheduling
- We just prove StarForth correctness
- Faster to market

**Phase 2 (seL4):**
- External microkernel but formally verified
- We reuse seL4 proofs for isolation/scheduling
- Adds credibility without duplicating effort

**Phase 3 (StarForth kernel):**
- We prove everything ourselves
- Complete control
- Maximum assurance

== What We Will NOT Do

=== No Compliance Theater

❌ We will not claim certifications we don't have (ISO 9001, medical device, etc.)
❌ We will not include irrelevant standards
❌ We will not generate documents nobody will read

✓ We will only claim what we can defend
✓ We will only require evidence we will actually generate
✓ We will focus on meaningful validation

=== No Shortcuts on Tier III

❌ We will not skip formal verification if we claim "kernel"
❌ We will not use unproven theorem libraries
❌ We will not accept "looks correct" — it must be proven

✓ When we claim formal verification, we mean Isabelle/HOL with machine-checked proofs
✓ Every theorem will be provable (no "sorry" statements)
✓ Proofs will be peer-reviewed

== Standards Alignment

This governance strategy aligns with:

| Standard | How We Use It |
|----------|---------------|
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 | Lifecycle model (Tier I) |
| ISO/IEC 25010 | Quality model (Tier I-II) |
| IEEE 730 | SQA planning (Tier I) |
| IEEE 1012 | V&V planning (all tiers) |
| ISO/IEC 5055 | Code quality (Tier II) |
| MISRA C:2023 | Secure coding (Tier II) |
| SEI CERT C | Secure coding (Tier II) |
| NIST SSDF | Software development framework (Tier II) |
| Isabelle/HOL | Theorem proving (Tier III) |
| seL4 methodology | Formal verification (Tier III) |

**See:** `STANDARDS_REFERENCE.adoc` for complete mapping

== Key Principles

=== 1. Evidence-Based Validation

Every claim is backed by evidence:
- Tests (675+ for FORTH-79 compliance)
- Code analysis (static analysis tools)
- Documentation (requirements traceability)
- Measurements (code quality metrics)

### 2. Incremental Completion

We don't wait for perfection:
- Tier I? Complete and documented
- Tier II? Complete and documented
- Tier III? TBD and clearly marked as future work

### 3. Traceable Everything

Requirements → Code → Tests → Results → Deficiencies → Corrections

Every artifact connects to every other artifact.

### 4. Deficiency Management

If something doesn't pass:
1. Log it (date, what, why, severity)
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix it
4. Re-test
5. Close deficiency
6. Update metrics

Nothing is hidden or swept under the rug.

### 5. Design for Phase Evolution

Tier I-II validates a VM. Tier III validates a kernel. The structure doesn't change—just the scope grows.

- All deficiencies are **tracked** (visible deficiency log)
- All corrections are **documented** (before/after evidence)

**We want to be defensible, not defensive.**
