= StarForth Tier I: Foundation Overview

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025

- ---

== What is Tier I?

Tier I validates that **StarForth is a correct, complete FORTH-79 implementation** with clear documentation and comprehensive testing.

**Success criteria:** StarForth does what it claims (FORTH-79 compliance) and can be understood and maintained.

- ---

== Why Tier I Matters

=== Without Tier I

- - [ ] We don't know if StarForth actually implements FORTH-79
- - [ ] Code changes might break compliance without detection
- - [ ] New developers can't understand the architecture
- - [ ] We can't defend claims about correctness
- - [ ] No audit trail for decisions

### With Tier I

- - ✓ Every FORTH-79 word tested and proven correct
- - ✓ All changes traceable to requirements
- - ✓ Architecture documented and understood
- - ✓ Can defend correctness to any audience
- - ✓ Clear audit trail for all work

- ---

## Tier I Charter

**What we're validating:** Correctness and completeness of FORTH-79 implementation

**What we're NOT validating:**
- - ✗ Security (that's Tier II)
- - ✗ Performance (out of scope)
- - ✗ Formal proofs (that's Tier III)
- - ✗ System-level integration (that's StarshipOS governance)

- ---

## Tier I Scope: Four Validation Areas

=== Area T1-1: FORTH-79 Standard Compliance

**Question:** Does StarForth implement all FORTH-79 core words correctly?

**Validation:**
- - 70 core words mapped to implementation
- - 675+ test cases covering all words
- - Edge cases and stress tests
- - Multi-platform validation (x86_64, ARM64, etc.)

**Evidence:**
- - `FORTH-79_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.adoc` — Word inventory
- - Test results logs — All tests pass
- - Platform coverage report — Tested on all platforms

- ---

=== Area T1-2: Requirements Traceability

**Question:** Does every piece of code trace back to a requirement, and is every test linked to code?

**Validation:**
- - Formal specification defining what StarForth is
- - Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) mapping:
  - REQ → Implementation → Test
- - No orphan code (code with no requirement)
- - No orphan tests (tests with no requirement)

**Evidence:**
- - `REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.adoc` — What are we building?
- - RTM spreadsheet — What maps to what?
- - Code-to-requirement map — Why does this code exist?

- ---

=== Area T1-3: Architecture & Design Documentation

**Question:** Can someone understand how StarForth works and why design choices were made?

**Validation:**
- - High-level architecture documented
- - All 19 modules described (purpose, words, dependencies)
- - Major design decisions explained (with rationale and tradeoffs)
- - Platform abstraction layer documented
- - Memory model specified

**Evidence:**
- - `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.adoc` — How it all fits together
- - `DESIGN_DECISIONS.adoc` — Why we chose this way
- - `WORD_MODULE_CATALOG.adoc` — What each module does
- - `PLATFORM_ABSTRACTION_LAYER.adoc` — How we handle multi-platform

- ---

=== Area T1-4: Test Methodology

**Question:** Are tests systematic, reproducible, and comprehensive?

**Validation:**
- - Test plan defines strategy
- - All test cases specified (inputs, expected outputs)
- - Test coverage measured
- - Results logged with reproducibility data
- - No flaky tests

**Evidence:**
- - `TEST_PLAN.adoc` — Testing strategy
- - `TEST_CASE_SPECIFICATION.adoc` — Each test defined
- - Test coverage report — >90% coverage
- - Test results log — Each run documented

- ---
