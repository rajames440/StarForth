## Recommendations

**For Tier II Commencement:**
- Proceed with Tier II Quality validation (no blockers)
- Allocate resources for static code analysis
- Set up SonarQube or equivalent baseline

**For Future Phases:**
- Phase 2 (seL4 port): Extend Tier I validation to seL4 platform
- Phase 3 (Kernel): Proceed to Tier III formal verification
