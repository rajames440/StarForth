= StarForth Tier II: Acceptance Criteria

**Version:** 1.0.0

== T2-1: Code Quality

- [ ] SonarQube baseline established
- [ ] Critical issues = 0
- [ ] High issues <5
- [ ] Code duplication <5%
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity avg <10
- [ ] Report signed and dated

== T2-2: Secure Coding (MISRA C)

- [ ] MISRA C:2023 checklist complete
- [ ] All applicable rules compliant
- [ ] Exceptions documented with rationale
- [ ] Checklist reviewed

== T2-3: Secure Coding (CERT C)

- [ ] CERT C critical rules reviewed
- [ ] No vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] Exceptions documented
- [ ] Code review completed

== T2-4: Memory Safety

- [ ] MEMORY_SAFETY_SPECIFICATION.adoc complete
- [ ] Fixed arena verified (5MB, no malloc)
- [ ] Stack bounds documented (1024 cells)
- [ ] Bounds checking verified
- [ ] AddressSanitizer: 0 errors
- [ ] Tests pass with sanitizers enabled

== T2-5: Deterministic Execution

- [ ] DETERMINISM_SPECIFICATION.adoc complete
- [ ] Code audit: no time() calls, no random()
- [ ] 100x identical test runs all match
- [ ] Execution is reproducible

== T2-5: Capability Readiness

- [ ] WORD_CALL_PATTERN_SPECIFICATION.adoc
- [ ] DICTIONARY_SECURITY_ANALYSIS.adoc
- [ ] ACL_INTEGRATION_POINTS.adoc
- [ ] Capability architecture documented

== T2-6: ACL Caching Strategy (NEW)

- [ ] `ACL_CACHING_STRATEGY.adoc` reviewed and understood
- [ ] Compile-time ACL resolution algorithm documented
- [ ] Cache structure and invalidation strategy designed
- [ ] Cache validation tests implemented and passing
- [ ] Performance baseline established (cache hits < cache misses by >10x)
- [ ] Revocation window verified (TTL enforcement)
- [ ] No cache bypass vulnerabilities found

**Validation Tests:**
- [ ] T2-6A: Compile-time ACL calculation correct (unit tests)
- [ ] T2-6B: Cache lookup behavior correct (integration tests)
- [ ] T2-6C: Revocation enforcement works (capability change tests)
- [ ] T2-6D: Performance meets expectations (benchmark tests)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All compile-time ACL tests pass
- [ ] All cache behavior tests pass
- [ ] Revocation is effective within TTL window
- [ ] Cache overhead is minimal (<1MB for 100 VMs Ã— 1000 words)
- [ ] Hot path performance (cache hit): negligible overhead
- [ ] No ACL bypasses via cache manipulation

== Tier II Status

**PASS if:**
- All six sub-criteria T2-1 through T2-6 PASS
- Code quality metrics meet thresholds
- All documentation complete
- ACL caching strategy validated
- No CRITICAL deficiencies

**FAIL if:**
- Code quality below threshold
- Unresolved security issues
- Documentation incomplete
- Cache behavior fails validation
- ACL bypass vulnerabilities found
