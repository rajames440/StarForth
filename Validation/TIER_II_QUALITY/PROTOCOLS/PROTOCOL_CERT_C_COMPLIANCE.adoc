= StarForth Tier II: CERT C Compliance Protocol

**Document ID:** starforth-governance/protocol-cert-c-compliance
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** Ready for Execution

---

== Protocol Overview

This protocol verifies StarForth compliance with CERT C secure coding practices, focusing on security vulnerabilities and defensive programming.

**Success Criteria:**
- CERT C critical rules reviewed
- No security vulnerabilities identified
- All exceptions documented with risk acceptance
- Code security review completed and signed

---

== Phase 1: CERT C Critical Rules

=== 1.1 Priority 1 Rules (Critical)

Review all CERT C Priority 1 rules:

**ARR (Array Handling)**
- ARR30-C: Do not form or use out-of-bounds pointers or array subscripts
- ARR32-C: Ensure size arguments for variable length arrays

**EXP (Expressions)**
- EXP42-C: Do not compare padding data
- EXP46-C: Do not use bitwise operators with Boolean-like operands

**FIO (File I/O)**
- FIO37-C: Do not assume character encoding is ASCII
- FIO46-C: Do not access a closed file

**INT (Integer Types)**
- INT32-C: Ensure that operations on signed integers do not result in overflow
- INT33-C: Ensure that division and remainder operations do not result in divide-by-zero

**MEM (Memory)**
- MEM30-C: Do not access freed memory
- MEM31-C: Free dynamically allocated memory when no longer needed
- MEM35-C: Allocate sufficient memory for an array of characters

**POS (POSIX)**
- POS54-C: Detect and handle file access race conditions

**PRE (Preprocessor)**
- PRE31-C: Avoid side-effects in arguments to unsafe macros

**STR (String Handling)**
- STR31-C: Guarantee that storage for strings has sufficient space

---

== Phase 2: Code Security Review

=== 2.1 Automated Scanning

**Tools:**
```bash
# Clang static analyzer
clang-tidy -checks="cert-*" src/

# GCC warnings for common issues
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wsecurity src/*.c
```

=== 2.2 Manual Security Code Review

For each critical area:
1. Integer overflow checks
2. Buffer overflow protection
3. Use-after-free prevention
4. Null pointer handling
5. File I/O security
6. Memory leak prevention
7. Race condition avoidance

---

== Phase 3: Vulnerability Assessment

=== 3.1 Common Vulnerability Patterns

Check for:
- CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
- CWE-680: Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow
- CWE-191: Integer Underflow
- CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
- CWE-785: Use of Path Manipulation Function without Maximum-sized Buffer
- CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable

=== 3.2 Documentation of Findings

For each potential vulnerability:
1. CWE number and description
2. Code location
3. Vulnerability description
4. Likelihood of exploitation
5. Impact if exploited
6. Mitigation in place
7. Risk acceptance (if applicable)
