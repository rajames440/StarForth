= StarForth Tier II: MISRA C:2023 Compliance Protocol

**Document ID:** starforth-governance/protocol-misra-c-compliance
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** Ready for Execution

---

== Protocol Overview

This protocol verifies StarForth compliance with MISRA C:2023 safe coding standard, ensuring defensive design and reduced vulnerability surface.

**Success Criteria:**
- MISRA C:2023 checklist complete with all applicable rules
- All violations documented with rationale
- No critical compliance gaps
- Checklist reviewed and signed

---

== Phase 1: MISRA C:2023 Rule Evaluation

=== 1.1 Mandatory Rules (Must Comply)

All mandatory rules must be met:
- Directives 4.1 (Trigraphs), 4.6 (Bit Fields), 4.9 (Storage Classes)
- Rule 1.3 (Character set restrictions)
- Rule 2.1 (Restrict operators)
- Rule 5.1 (Identifier uniqueness)
- Rule 11.2 (Pointer conversion to/from void)

=== 1.2 Advisory Rules (Strongly Recommended)

Advisory rules should be followed with documented exceptions:
- Magic numbers
- Unused parameters
- Code complexity
- Function length

=== 1.3 Documentation of Violations

For each violation:
1. Rule number and title
2. Location in code (file:line)
3. Violation description
4. Justification/rationale
5. Risk assessment
6. Mitigation (if applicable)

---

== Phase 2: Tool-Based Compliance Checking

=== 2.1 MISRA Checker Tools

**Recommended Tools:**
- Clang with MISRA plugins
- cppcheck with MISRA rules
- Helix QAC (commercial)
- ECLAIR (commercial)

**Setup:**
```bash
# cppcheck with MISRA configuration
cppcheck --std=c99 --addon=misra \
         --template=csv src/ > misra-report.csv

# Clang static analyzer for subset
clang-tidy -checks="readability-*,safety-*" src/
```

=== 2.2 Manual Code Review

For rules not covered by automated tools:
1. Perform systematic code walk-through
2. Document each rule evaluation
3. Create evidence of review (comments, sign-off)

---

== Phase 3: Compliance Checklist

Create MISRA_C_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.adoc with:

[cols="1,2,1,2"]
|===
| Rule # | Title | Compliant? | Notes

| D4.1 | Trigraphs | ✓ | Not used
| D4.6 | Bit field types | ✓ | Fixed-width integers only
| (etc...) | | |
|===

**Checklist Sections:**
- Directives (Mandatory)
- Syntax rules (Mandatory)
- Type rules (Mandatory)
- Declarators and Definitions
- Expressions and Operators
- Control Statements
- Functions
- Declarations and Definitions
- Initializations
- Types
- Pointer Type Conversions
- Pointer Arithmetic
- Logical Operators
- Bit Operations
- Constants
- Preprocessing Directives

---

== Phase 4: Exception Handling

=== 4.1 Documented Exceptions

For each exception to MISRA rules:

1. **Rule ID and Title**
2. **Location** (file, line range)
3. **Justification** (why exception is necessary)
4. **Risk Assessment** (what is the risk?)
5. **Mitigation** (how is risk managed?)
6. **Approval** (signed by maintainer)

Example:
```
Rule 11.2 (Pointer conversion to/from void)
Location: src/vm.c:45-50
Justification: VM memory abstraction requires void* for generic memory access
Risk: Type safety not enforced by compiler
Mitigation: All void* operations validated at VM boundaries
Approved: [Signature]
```

=== 4.2 Exception Categories

- Performance-critical code (justified)
- Platform-specific code (documented)
- Legacy code (noted for refactoring)
- Architectural necessity (explained)

---

== Phase 5: Review and Sign-Off

=== 5.1 Compliance Review

- [ ] All applicable rules reviewed
- [ ] All exceptions documented
- [ ] No undocumented violations
- [ ] Checklist complete and accurate
- [ ] Code changes (if needed) completed

=== 5.2 Documentation

Generate MISRA_C_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.adoc containing:
- Complete rule-by-rule evaluation
- Compliance status for each rule
- All exceptions with rationale
- Evidence of review
- Approval signatures

---

== Success Criteria

✓ PASS when all of the following are true:
- [ ] MISRA C:2023 checklist 100% complete
- [ ] All applicable rules reviewed
- [ ] Mandatory rules fully compliant
- [ ] Advisory rules mostly compliant (>90%)
- [ ] All exceptions documented with rationale
- [ ] No critical compliance gaps
- [ ] Checklist reviewed and signed

✗ FAIL if:
- [ ] Mandatory rule violations not documented
- [ ] Checklist incomplete
- [ ] Exceptions lack justification
- [ ] Critical security violations found
